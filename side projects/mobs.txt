&+Ca huge multisegmented worm&N~
&+CA huge multisegmented worm circles the area slowly.&N~
Appearing quite similar to a massive millipede, this giant worm
crawls about the area, leaving a thin trail of foul-smelling ooze.
Although no visible sensory receptors can be seen, it is clear that
this worm is very much aware of and in tune with its surroundings.

&+La powerful orc warrior&N~
&+LA powerful orc warrior wanders the area, weapons at the ready.&N~
Clearly an experienced member of his race, this stout individual appears
constantly ready for battle.  His pig-like snout sniffs the air, snorting
slightly.  A foul smell seems to hang in the air around him, likely
emenating from the filthy and clearly well-worn armor that seems to cling
to him like a second skin.

&+Ba hulking barbarian warrior&N~
&+BA hulking barbarian warrior sniffs the air warily.&N~
Rather large, even for a barbarian, this stern individual walks about
cautiously as though sensing some unseen presence.  His light armor is
worn from battle and gleams dully against his dark, sun-tanned skin.
Here and there, tattoos paying tribute to the gods of battle can be seen
wherever skin is visible beneath his armor.

&+ca dwarven warrior&N~
&+cA dwarven warrior moves cautiously through the area.&N~
Scarred and battered by a lifetime of battle, this warrior has the
keen look of experience in his dark eyes.  His armor, much like his
scarred face, bears the marks of countless battles won and lost.  
Despite his hard appearance, his long, flowing beard has been neatly
kept and his axe gleams brightly as though recently polished.

&+gA gnome warrior stands here, daring anyone to challenge him.&N~
Although not known for their ferocity as warriors, this particular
gnome appears to have seen a great many battles in his day.  His face
bears the occasional scar of a wound long-healed, particularily his
round, bulbous nose.

&+gAn XXX elven huntress stalks the area.&N~
The cat-like precision with which this huntress moves clearly marks
her as a dangerous individual.  Although a deadly foe, her features
are actually quite delicate and lovely.  Thin, pointed ears protrude
from her black, shortly-cropped hair.  Deep, mist-green eyes look
calmly about, investigating everything in the area.

&+gA half-elven ranger tracks his prey through the area.&N~
Slighly pointed ears under a thick head of raven-black hair help to
frame the chiseled and well-definied face of this swarthy ranger.
Dressed in light, loose-fitting leather garb, this half-elf sneaks
through the area as though a part of nature itself.  The greenish
tint of his clothing helping to camoflague him even further amid
the greenery.

hands drag along on the ground behind it as it walks slowly about.
The troll's yellowish-green skin sprouts random, thick patches of 
black hair, giving it a very wild appearance.

hulking form as it shuffles about looking for prey.

&+yan especially ugly ogre stands here, club over his shoulder.&N~
Hideous even for one of his species, this ogre appears to have been in
a great number of battles in his time.  Crooked, yellowed teeth protrude
at odd angles from his gaping, drooling mouth.  A scarred, bulbous nose
takes up a majority of the rest of his face.  The massive club slung over 
his shoulder still bears the dried blood and bits of flesh from the last
hapless victim to cross his path.

Although most of his kind are known for their towering height and
impressive physiques, this particular giant is not only tall, but 
quite wide as well.  His overgrown belly hangs down well below the line
of his thick leather belt, making it as difficult to see around this
fellow as over him.
