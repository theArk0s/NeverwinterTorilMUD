The Song of Nine

From magics born of long ago
And hearts enthralled with greed
Shall come a song of sad and woe
And one heroic deed.
For gather round, and listen well
If you may find the time
And I shall sing a song for you
Of Neverwinter's Nine.

Now many think, and wrongly so
That the Nine mere mortals be
But Gems instead, the legends go
Are truly what you seek.
Forged by magic, cast about
For men to hunt and find
The truth be told, worth more than gold
Are the fabled Gems of Nine.

Forged to rule the Realms they were
All good to cast aside
But lesser known about them is
They were once one and nine.
The tenth the darkest of them all
An orb of purest night
And from it darkest demons rose
The souls of men to blight.

When armies drew across the lands
And kingdoms broke and splintered
Arose a hero, nobly born
First Lord of Neverwinter.
The secrets of the gems he knew
And to stem the warring tide
The demon generals all he slew
And banished them inside.

Nine demons captured, one yet rested
In darkest orb contained
But 'ere his eternal foe he bested
Lord Halueth was slain.
The second Lord, his dear successor
Nine Gems he ordered scattered
The demons inside, not to awaken
The tenth he ordered shattered.

But knew not he, that to the orb
Shattered was not yet broken.
Should the pieces reunite
So too evil, it was spoken.
Should all Nine Gems united be
With the shards of pain and death,
The demons all shall be set free
Again to draw their breath.

Ages have passed, as well the Gems
From one Lord to the next
Though protected by the Nine they chose
Not all have passed the test.
Some in fear and some in greed
Have sought to rule the Gems
But one by one, in cursed luck
Death got the best of them.

But Nashar wisely chose his guards
To keep the thieves away
Indeed the gems are mighty cards
Which keep fell beasts at bay.
Cyntan, Silme and Vagan
All heroes of the land,
Aermor the priestess fair
and Evema the black hand.
Laurenthyl the peaceful bard
And Aldan triplet-born
Lhoge the diplomatic dwarf,
Foreign Imdar the forlorn.

They the mortal keepers are
Though not the first nor last.
And for the Nine Immortal Gems-
this present too, shall pass.
