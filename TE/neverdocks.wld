&+b   The softly rolling waves of the Trackless Sea undulate in an almost

&+LAlong the Seawalls of &N&+cNeverwinter&N
~
&+w   The high, grayish stone walls of the city of Neverwinter rise high into
&+wthe air along the eastern side of this wide walkway.  Paved with heavy
&+wstones, this wide thoroughfare provides a sturdy means of transporting the
&+wheavy crates and barrels of shipped goods back and forth between the many
&+wdocks of the city and the numerous warehouses sheltered protectively within
&+wthe city walls.  The stony contstruction of the roadway also helps protect
&+wthe city walls from the erosion caused by the continuous pounding of the
&+wwaves from the Trackless Sea.  While Neverwinter's natural harbor provides
&+wa great deal of shelter for vessels, the powerful storms of the north can
&+wquickly blow in and make even the most sheltered of waters treacherous.  The
&+wsalt smell in the air reflects the cool, light mist churned up by the
&+wconstant crashing of the waves onto the stone breakers below.  The somewhat
&+wdeafening noise of the waves is interrupted only by the shouts and commotion
&+wfrom the nearby docks, and the occasional screech from an overhead gull.&N~

&+LAlong the &N&+yDocks&+L of &N&+cNeverwinter&N
~
&+y   The thick, aged wood of the docks creaks and moans gently through here,
&+yreflecting the unseen but constant force of the surrounding tides.  Although
&+ya great majority of the docks are supported by sturdy stone construction,
&+yseveral long spans cross the open waters supported by no more than a few,
&+ythick wooden posts.  Large sailing ships can be seen littering the numerous
&+ydocs of the city, their massive masts swaying gently with the waves.  Large
&+ypiles of wooden crates and shipping containers are stacked along the surface
&+yof the docks, awaiting their loading or transport into the city.  Large,
&+yburly dockworkers meander about as they slowly bring order to the chaos of
&+ythe shipyards.  A cool, constant breeze blows through the area, billowing
&+ythe sails of departing ships as they make their way to trade centers
&+ythroughout the realms.&N

&+LAlong the Seawalls of &N&+cNeverwinter&N
~
&+w   The high, grayish stone walls of the city of Neverwinter rise high into
&+wthe air along the eastern side of this wide walkway.  Paved with heavy
&+wstones, this wide thoroughfare provides a sturdy means of transporting the
&+wheavy crates and barrels of shipped goods back and forth between the many
&+wdocks of the city and the numerous warehouses sheltered protectively within
&+wthe city walls.  The stony contstruction of the roadway also helps protect
&+wthe city walls from the erosion caused by the continuous pounding of the
&+wwaves from the Trackless Sea.  While Neverwinter's natural harbor provides
&+wa great deal of shelter for vessels, the powerful storms of the north can
&+wquickly blow in and make even the most sheltered of waters treacherous.  The
&+wsalt smell in the air reflects the cool, light mist churned up by the
&+wconstant crashing of the waves onto the stone breakers below.  The somewhat
&+wdeafening noise of the waves is interrupted only by the shouts and commotion
&+wfrom the nearby docks, and the occasional screech from an overhead gull.&N~

&+LAlong the &N&+yDocks&+L of &N&+cNeverwinter&N
~
&+y   The thick, aged wood of the docks creaks and moans gently through here,
&+yreflecting the unseen but constant force of the surrounding tides.  Although
&+ya great majority of the docks are supported by sturdy stone construction,
&+yseveral long spans cross the open waters supported by no more than a few,
&+ythick wooden posts.  Large sailing ships can be seen littering the numerous
&+ydocs of the city, their massive masts swaying gently with the waves.  Large
&+ypiles of wooden crates and shipping containers are stacked along the surface
&+yof the docks, awaiting their loading or transport into the city.  Large,
&+yburly dockworkers meander about as they slowly bring order to the chaos of
&+ythe shipyards.  A cool, constant breeze blows through the area, billowing
&+ythe sails of departing ships as they make their way to trade centers
&+ythroughout the realms.&N

&+LOutside the Dock Gates of Neverwinter&N
~
&+L   The massive steel and wood gates of the city of Neverwinter stand just to
&+Lthe east of here.  Large, heavy carts laden with goods from throughout the
&+Lrealms make their way back and forth through their gaping maw, shuttling
&+Lback and forth between the massive warehouses of the city and the ships
&+Leagerly awaiting their cargo on the docks.  Teamsters on the wagons shout
&+Lloudly at one another, greeting old friends or expressing frustration at the
&+Lcongestion.  Numerous merchants and businessmen make their way back and forth
&+Las well, inspecting their goods, or seeking to do business with one another.
&+LHere and there, large, dangerous-looking seamen make their way amongst the
&+Lthrong, heading into the sprawling city to take their shore leave.  The
&+Lgeneral chaos is kept orderly only by the presence of a great deal of equally
&+Ldangerous, well-armed guards bearing the crest of the city of Neverwinter.
&+LThe docks of the city continue north and south of here while Neverwinter
&+Llies through the gates to the east.&N~

&+cFloating on the &+BTrackless Sea&N

&+b   The softly rolling waves of the Trackless Sea undulate in an almost
&+bhypnotic fashion for as far as the eye can see.  The deep, greenish-blue of
&+bthe water hints at the almost unfathomable depths that hide beneath the
&+bsurface.  Countless sailors have lost their lives in these waters, some
&+btempted by the freedom of the seas, others by the allure of adventure and
&+bthe countless lands that line the shores of the great oceans.  Far to the
&+beast of here, where the reflected light sparkles like diamonds on the

&+LAlong the Seawalls of &N&+cNeverwinter&N
~
&+w   The high, grayish stone walls of the city of Neverwinter rise high into
&+wthe air along the eastern side of this wide walkway.  Paved with heavy
&+wstones, this wide thoroughfare provides a sturdy means of transporting the
&+wheavy crates and barrels of shipped goods back and forth between the many
&+wdocks of the city and the numerous warehouses sheltered protectively within
&+wthe city walls.  The stony contstruction of the roadway also helps protect
&+wthe city walls from the erosion caused by the continuous pounding of the
&+wwaves from the Trackless Sea.  While Neverwinter's natural harbor provides
&+wa great deal of shelter for vessels, the powerful storms of the north can
&+wquickly blow in and make even the most sheltered of waters treacherous.  The
&+wsalt smell in the air reflects the cool, light mist churned up by the
&+wconstant crashing of the waves onto the stone breakers below.  The somewhat
&+wdeafening noise of the waves is interrupted only by the shouts and commotion
&+wfrom the nearby docks, and the occasional screech from an overhead gull.&N~

&+LAlong the Seawalls of &N&+cNeverwinter&N
~
&+w   The high, grayish stone walls of the city of Neverwinter rise high into
&+wthe air along the eastern side of this wide walkway.  Paved with heavy
&+wstones, this wide thoroughfare provides a sturdy means of transporting the
&+wheavy crates and barrels of shipped goods back and forth between the many
&+wdocks of the city and the numerous warehouses sheltered protectively within
&+wthe city walls.  The stony contstruction of the roadway also helps protect
&+wthe city walls from the erosion caused by the continuous pounding of the
&+wwaves from the Trackless Sea.  While Neverwinter's natural harbor provides
&+wa great deal of shelter for vessels, the powerful storms of the north can
&+wquickly blow in and make even the most sheltered of waters treacherous.  The
&+wsalt smell in the air reflects the cool, light mist churned up by the
&+wconstant crashing of the waves onto the stone breakers below.  The somewhat
&+wdeafening noise of the waves is interrupted only by the shouts and commotion
&+wfrom the nearby docks, and the occasional screech from an overhead gull.&N~
