&+LOutside the &+WNorthwestern Gates of Neverwinter&N~
   Here, a wide stone bridge spans the Neverwinter River between the High 
Road and the walled city of &+wNeverwinter&N.  The bridge is obviously of 
very sturdy contstruction and sees a great deal of use from travelers and 
merchants alike.  High stone railings line the bridge's sides where banners 
bear intricate designs of the Great Seal of the City of Neverwinter.  Far 
below, the warm waters of the Neverwinter River flow westward in their trek 
towards the Trackless Sea.  The huge gates of Neverwinter lie south of here, 
a remnant of the days long ago when wandering orc hordes threatened to 
overrun the city.  However, relatively peaceful as these times may be, the 
city guards still diligently patrol the walls in a perpetual watch for 
danger.

&+rInside A Large Tower&N~
&+L   Here, where the great stone walls surrounding Neverwinter converge, a 
&+Llarge tower has been consructed.  In this corner of the tower, a spiral 
&+Lstone staircase heads upwards to the walkway along the top of the city 
&+Lwalls.  Small windows look out from the northern and western walls which 
&+Lcan double as arrow slots for archers in the event of an attack.  From the 
&+Llooks of things, though, this tower has seen very little use in its time.  
&+LThe sound of the ocean crashing on the shore can be heard through the 
&+Lthick stone walls, indicating the proximity to the Trackless Sea.&N

&+L   This small stone chamber is used to stockpile weapons and armor for the 
&+Lcity guards to use in the event of an attack.  Here and there, standard 
&+Lissue longswords and leather armor lie about in piles.  The thin layer of 
&+Ldust over just about everything in the room shows that there has been very 
&+Llittle demand for these supplies in recent years.  Here and there, a mouse

&+yA Small Dwelling&N~
   This small dwelling has been built right up against the city walls here.  
Despite its small size, it is relatively well-kept.  Even the poorest 
inhabitants of Neverwinter can usually afford a modest home of their own.  
The owner of the house is most likely a lower-class worker for one of the 
various warehouses in town.  In the windows of this room, small potted 
flowers have been planted and add a pleasant odor to the air of the place.  A 
small fireplace dug into the floor in the corner serves to both heat the room 
in winter and provide a place for cooking.  A narrow doorway heads east into 
an ajoining room, most likely a bedroom of some kind.

a small amount of ventilation.  A small wooden dresser stands in the back 
corner of the room, most likely storing the family's few meager possessions.  
This room, much like the other, is fairly clean and appears pretty well-
kept.  A narrow doorway leads out into the entrance room.

&+rThe Sleeping Quarters in the Barracks&N~
   Row upon row of bunks line the room here, each with a small wooden chest 
tucked neatly beneath it.  The sparse living quarters attest to the lowly 
status of the regulars in the town guard.  Despite the spartan decor and 
living conditions, the members of the town guard are well paid and, once 
elevated to the status of elite guard, they enjoy a fairly high standard of 
living.  A stack of freshly cut wood stands next to a large fireplace in the 
far wall drying out so that it can be used for heat during Neverwinter's long 
and hard winters.  A large stone doorway opens up in the eastern wall to the 
entrance of the barracks.

   This room servers as a storage room and shelter from the elements for the

outside, the guards will come in here to warm up.  Large windows open up in 
the eastern and southern walls and allow the guards a wide view of the small 
courtyard just inside the city gates here.  Unadorned wooden benches line the 
walls in here, allowing patrolling guards to rest their weary legs during 
changes in the watch.  A small desk in the corner indicates that this also 
serves as something of a staging office in the event of an arrest.  A strong 
oaken door leads east from here.

&+LInside the Northwestern Gates of Neverwinter&N~
   Two gates bound with iron and decorated with shining Mithril protect 
the Northern entrance to the city of Neverwinter.  Made by the dwarves of 
Mithril Hall, these gates are made to withstand attacks from hostile 
Luskan to the north.  The gates are anchored to the city's thick walls on 
either side by giant iron hinges and a portcullis is waiting above to 
further prevent any potential invaders from gaining access to the city.  
The gates here have just been replaced and are much newer than at the 
other entrances to Neverwinter.  Unlike at most of the other gates of 
Neverwinter, however, the walkway along the top of the city walls here 
provides almost no shelter from the elements.

&+Las though this tower could use some renovation.  A small stack of fresh 
&+Lblocks in the corner, along with some mortar mix and trowels would 
&+Lindicate that such a renovation is being planned, but has not yet begun.  
&+LAn ancient stone staircase leads upwards to the path atop the city walls.  
&+LAlthough the rest of the tower appears to be in poor shape, the staircase 
&+Llooks to be in sound condition.  A thick oaken door leads west from the

&+rEntrance to the Northwest Tower&N~
&+L   This large room serves as the entrance chamber for the northwest tower 
&+Lof the city of Neverwinter.  In times of war, these towers serve as 
&+Llookout points and archer towers for the defense of the city from 
&+Lattackers.  In the past, hostile parties from nearby Luskan frequently 
&+Lassaulted the city and these towers proved crucial to the city's defense.  
&+LIn recent years, though, the city of Neverwinter has seen very little 
&+Lconflict and these towers have gone largely unused.  A high stone archway 
&+Lleads north to a staircase leading up to the top of the city walls, while

it look as though a vicious sword fight must have taken place here.  In 
places, tiny splotches of blood on the ground also tend to point to the 
possibility of a large fight of some sort.  A musty odor seems to permeate

the place and occasionally stick there heads out of the large cracks between 
the blocks of the walls.  The blocks themselves appear to be somewhat damp 
and mildewed, making this place look even less inviting.  Such dwellings are 
very rare in Neverwinter, but apparently a few do exist.  A small doorway

some of it appears to have been collected in a corner of the dwelling by the

&+C   The well-paved northern plaza of Neverwinter continues through here.  A 
&+Csmall fountain in this corner of the plaza pleasantly gurgles with crystal 
&+Cclear water as people hurry about.  Here and there, adventurers are stretched 
&+Cout, relaxing near the fountain waters as they prepare to venture out into 
&+Cthe reaches of the far north in search of fame and fortune.  A small flock of 
&+Cpigeons also hovers about in the area, diving upon tiny scraps of food.  The 
&+Cplaza continues north and west from here.&N

&+LInside a Large Building&N~
   Small boxes and crates are stacked in the corners of this room.  From the 
looks of things, it seems that this building serves as a small staging area 
for the shipments of goods around the city.  Cobwebs cling to the ceiling in 
places, but in general the room seems well-kept.  A ladder attached to the 
northern wall leads up through a trap door in the ceiling to the roof of the 
building.

End of the Quaint-Looking Alleyway~
   The quaint and flower-filled alleyway comes to an end here in a jumble of 
tiny buildings.  The paving stones of the alley are extremely rough and 
uneven here, but have been worn smooth and slick with age.  Surrounding the 
end of the alley, the old brick buildings of the warehouse district look 
oddly tired and depressed.  A tiny tavern, aptly named "The Warhouse", rests 
off to the east while a tiny dwelling of some sort lies north of here.

&+yThe Warehouse Tavern&N~
   One of the few taverns in the warehouse district, this quaint little bar 
is one of the few hang-outs for the many warehouse workers of Neverwinter.  
Like many, if not all of the taverns in Neverwinter, this tavern is very 
well-kept exhibits a great deal of refinement, despite its meager 
surroundings.  The smell of fresh moss stew provides a very pleasant odor to 
the place and several patrons are seated at the long bar along the back wall.
A tiny doorway leads north into a back room of some sort.

   This dirty, little, one-room apartment could hardly be considered livable, 
even by the lower standards of the warehouse district.  A thin layer of 
rotting garbage lies strewn across the ground and emits a terrible odor.  The 
buzz of swarms of flies and insects is almost deafening in here and sickly 
rats run around in the filth, no doubt carrying numerous diseases.  Anyone 
unfortunate enough to call this place home must be poor indeed.  The only 
visible exit is back through the doorway to the east to the street along the 
city walls.

&+Lstill provide adequate support for the shipments of goods that move through

now and then, but none of the creatures ever makes an appearance.  The walls 
of the hallway are well plastered and appear as though they receive a good 
amount of care, perhaps indicating that this hallway is still in regular 
usage.  From here, the hallway continues both north towards a small room, and 
south towards another room of sorts.

A Bend in the Dingy Alleyway~
   The narrow alleyway slowly bends through here as it skirts between the 
large buildings of the warehouse district.  In the middle of the walkway, 
here, is a large slimy grate into which drains a steady trickle of water.  
The grate emits a foul odor and there is no doubt that it leads directly into 
the sewers of Neverwinter.  On both sides of the alley, tall buildings, most 
likely warehouses of some sort, rise high above the city.  To the east and 
south, the alley continues.

from the roofs of the building and drain into the unseen sewers of 
Neverwinter.  Here and there, rats poke about in the piles of trash and 
discarded crates, looking for homes and something to eat.  The top of this 
alley is partially covered by an overhead walkway between the two buildings 
which only adds to the gloom of this place.  The alley continues both north

decades, the old building now serves no known purpose.  Another large

   The smell of rotting flesh in this room is practically unbearable.  Like 
the first room in this dwelling, the walls of this room have been ripped open 
and furniture lies strewn about on the floor.  Here and there, piles of 
clothing have been thrown about, and a delapidated bed near the northern wall 
marks this room a having been a bedroom of sorts.  A tiny window in the 
eastern wall provides some ventilation, but also serves as a conduit for the 
clouds of flies which have begun to accumulate in this room.  A wood-framed

helps to keep the goods stored in this building out of the elements.  The 
various boxes and crates stacked in this building contain goods of all sorts 
which are destined for other markets around the realms.  Neverwinter's 
bustling sea trade and northern location on the High Road make its warehouses 
a popular choice for merchants who wish to transport goods throughout the 
Realms.

Crates and boxes are stacked on wooden pallets and appear ready for shipment

Neverwinter's many smuggling groups for transporting illegal goods in and out 
of the city.  The room appears deserted at the moment, but with the stacks of 
goods that appear ready for shipment, it is a safe bet that the smugglers 
will not be gone for too long.  A large trapdoor in the floor leads downwards

clealy seen better day and is entirely covered by filth and dirt in most 
places.  Every now and then, a bird or two will flit by overhead, but the 
primary inhabitants of this place are clearly the numerous rats which scurry 
about in the numerous shadows of the place.  The dingy alley continues

poorer areas of cities like Waterdeep, this is clearly this is not the most 
affluent neighborhood of Neverwinter.  Only the very poorest or most devious 
of people would call this area their home.  Off to the east, a dark and

terrible-looking dwelling lies off to the west.  The street itself runs to

alleyways such as this one are the source of the more dangerous elements of 
Neverwinter's warehouse district.  Although fairly wide at its opening near 
the city walls, this alley quickly narrows as it winds between buildings and 
is almost always shrouded in shadows.  Empty crates and boxes line the sides 
of the alley and only add to the sinister appearance of this place.  The

is quite possible that the shadows of the alleyway hide more than just rats 
and rotting garbage.  The slick, slimy stones of the alleyway bend west and 
north as they make their way through here.

&+mrich wood paneling continues through here, and small pedestals line the 
&+mhallway holding various statues and urns.  The floor of the hallway is

like it is well used.  Stacks of crates and barrels line the alley through

but many of them appear as though they have been here for quite some time.  
The shadows of the alley seem slightly deeper here, but that is most likely 
due to the height of the buildings surrounding the area.  The well-traveled, 
shady alleyway continues east and west through here while the smaller, 
darker, and more sinister-looking alley heads south.

   A particularily foul odor seems to permeate this particular stretch of the

which would seem to provide a good deal of shelter, this area of the alley 
seems well weathered and battered by the elements.  In places, moisture forms 
tiny rivulets on the walls of the alley, and a thick, hairy moss has taken 
hold in the shadiest corners.  The alley continues to the west and south.

to the city walls, it is amazing that erosion has not caused problems.  
Luckily for the city, the rocky banks of the river protect the high walls

buildings in northern Neverwinter.  This structure is used primarily by the 
merchants of Neverwinter for storing their goods while waiting for ships or 
caravans to take them to other parts of the realms.  The majority of the 
space in this building is taken up by boxes and crates of every size and 
shape.  A small table near the entrance serves as a post for a guard or other 
watchman to ensure the security of the goods while they await transport.

the neighborhoods surrounding it become.  Long shadows cover most of the 
ground through here, even during midday and shadowy figures move about 
quietly on agendas of their own.  To the west of here is a small, run-down 
warehouse which is typical of the poverty of the surrounding area.  East of 
here, however, rise the walls of a mammoth building which seem to be in very 
good condition.  It is clear that the building was originally just one of the 
city's many warehouses, but significant external improvements have been made 
recently.

traffic than the neighboring alleys.  These smaller alleyways of Neverwinter 
can be extremely dangerous, especially after dark.  The brick buildings 
surrounding the alleyway keep this area in shadows for most of the day and, 
as a result, the air in here is fairly cool and condensing water makes the

several bird nests have been built, most likely by the flocks of pigeons 
found in the city.  The rustling of rats from underneath the remains of the

   As the walkway curves from west to south here, small fortifications have
been made for archers and catapults.  Through the years, the defenses along
the city's walls have been in a constant state of change to keep 
Neverwinter's would-be enemies confused.  Unfortunately, this policy also 
leads to a certain amount of waste and confusion among the members of the 
city guard who are constantly re-positioned throughout the city.  Here, it 
appears as though a few birds have decided to make nests out of the remains 
of some of the fortifications.  The walkway continues west and south from

   Rather abruptly, the street along the city walls comes to an end here.  
Originally, this street would have continued the entire way around the walls 
inside the city of Neverwinter, but recent unregulated construction has 
started to block the road in places.  In times of war, this would never be 
allowed, but the recent peace has led to a rather lax attitude towards such 
matters.  At the end of the road, a dark and narrow alley leads off to the

   This extremely narrow and dark alleyway actually appears relatively clean, 
despite its remote location.  Small wooden crates and boxes are stacked 
neatly along the sides of the alley, each bearing the same, strange emblem. 
The path between the crates appears to be well-used, although the alley 
itself seems deserted at the moment.  Even though the alley appears cleaner 
and more used than many of its counterparts in the warehouse district, this 
place has a distinctively dangerous feel to it.  There is the distinct 
feeling of a presence of some sort watching the area.

   Here, the dark alleyway comes to an end at a pair of gigantic iron gates.  
Although heavily rusted, the iron gates to the east still appear extrememly

visible peepholes in the gate itself, but there are no doubt observation 
points hidden somewhere in the alleyway.  Clearly, whoever or whatever has 
constructed this place does not wish to have its activities disturbed.  The 
only other visible exit from the alleyway is back to the west.

many-pointed black star with a multi-legged sea creature of some sort at its 
center.  Surrounding the courtyard on all sides is an immense, multi-story, 
fortified compound.  The compound appears to have been a warehouse at one 
time, but seems to have recently undergone some serious improvements.  Large, 
carved oak doors lead into the compound to the north while the iron gates

smoothed, gray stones, most likely from the riverbed of the Neverwinter 
River.  Near the northern wall, the paving stones bear scratches as though 
something heavy were drug across them.  In the center of the floor, a plain 
stone stairway leads down into darkness.

&+c   As the Wyrmfrost Road winds northward through the city of Neverwinter, 
&+cit heads slightly downhill towards the great northern gates which can be 
&+cseen far in the distance.  Shouts from the various travelers and merchants 
&+cof the road echo off of the walls of the buildings through here which rise

&+ccan be seen with guards perched on the rooftops.  In the building just 
&+ceast of here is a large shop with a sign above the door reading &+L'Mawl's 
&+RHouse of War&+L'&N&+c.  The ring of a hammer and anvil can be heard coming from 
&+cwithin the shop and thick, black smoke wafts out from a soot-covered 
&+cchimney in the roof.  The Wyrmfrost Road continues both north and south

   The shadows continue to deepen here as the sinister-looking alley 
continues to wind through the warehouse district.  The sounds of dripping 
water and the occasional rustle from the shadows are the only noises that 
penetrate the darkness here.  Mist collects along the ground in places 
through here as the warmer air from Neverwinter's sewers rises and meets the 
cooler air of the alleys.  The sinister-looking alley bends to the east and 
south through here.

   The sinister-looking alleyway through the warehouse district bends 
slightly here as it makes its way between the buildings.  Occasional pools of 
murky water through here would seem to indicate that this particular section 
of the alleyway must be a relatively low point.  The odd smell to this 
section of the alley is most likely caused by the bits of rotting garbage and 
stagnant water lying about.  A dwelling of some sort lies to the south while 
the sinister alleyway heads west from here.  Off to the east lies the 
infamous and extremely dangerous0 alley of killers.

short alleyway is infamous for the murderers and theives which make it their 
home.  No one in their right mind ventures through these streets even during 
the daytime and definitely never at night.  Piles of garbage line the sides 
of this alley and the smell here is terrible, but bearable.  Long shadows 
shroud the alley to the south while a slightly wider and brighter alley lies 
to the west.  A dark little dwelling is north.

which are wicked-looking daggers.  At the tables and booths of the room, 
several dark figures are seated.  Most engage themselves in a silent drink,
while a select few hold hushed conversation.  The main room of the bar lies

Neverwinter in the center of town, the plants on Garden Street are kept
green and lively year round.  Neverwinter's higher standard of living allows
many of its citizens the small luxury of gardens of their own within the 
city, further adding to the natural splendor of the surroundings.  Garden
Street leads both north and south from here.

Apparently, construction or alteration of a building below here has caused 
minor changes in the city wall itself.  Although the walkway narrows 
somewhat, the small degree of change in no way affects the passability of 
this area.  Here and there, the battlements atop the city walls have started 
to age slightly and appear as though they could use some minor repairs.  The 
stone walkway along the city walls continues to the north and south from 
here.

Entrance to the Guild of Thieves~
   This darkened room serves as a small entryway and meeting chamber for the 
thieves of Neverwinter.  Although known as 'The City of Skilled Hands' for its
many craftsmen and artisans, the city of Neverwinter has always had its fair 
share of thieves who use their own skilled hands to prey on the multitude of 
merchants and travelers who frequent the city.  Although very powerful at one 
time, the guild of rogues in Neverwinter has declined in membership in the 
recent years, due largely to the increased patrols of the city guard and Lord
Nashar's strong stance against crime in the city.  The walls in this room are 
very sparse and the chamber itself is actually quite bare in general.  There 
is another room to the north, while a ladder towards the southern wall decends
down into darkness.

   This room seems must less crowded than the the main room, but no cleaner.  
In fact, the air in this room smells even more putrid than the other, if that 
is possible.  The few tables in this room are primarily unoccupied, but the 
darker recesses of the room appear to hold several patrons engaged in quiet 
discussions or negotiations.  Occasionally, loud grunts or cackles break the 
relative hush of the room, but such outbursts are rare.  The only visible

   Shouts and the sounds of breaking glass are the first sounds to greet 
anyone entering this filthy little tavern.  Glances ranging from guarded 
looks to the occasional hate-filled glare are the only acknowledgement that 
anyone recieves upon entering the bar.  Clouds of smoke mingle with the smell 
of sweat and spilled ale to give this place a definitely unappealing odor all 
its own.  Taking a closer look at the floor of the tavern, darker stains dot 
the floor here and there showing that some of the brawls here end less than 
peacefully.  A small door to the west leads to another of the tavern's rooms.

of the room lies a finely carved, oaken table.  High-backed, cushioned seats
line the side and ends of the table and look quite comfortable.  Light
shining in through tall windows in the walls appears to have had little 
effect in fading the beatiful surface of the table.  For colder nights, a
large fireplace resides in the western wall.  Minor smoke stains on the wall 
above the fireplace indicate that it sees a good deal of use.  To the east
lies the entry hall of the dwelling.

steal a drink from the putrid water, and then scurry back to its hiding 
place.  The alleyway continues both north and south from here.

   The smell of rotting wood and dust fills the air in this place.  Although
relatively clean compared to other dwellings in this area, this particular
home does not appear to have been lived in for a while.  A layer of dirt 
and small debris covers the floor, bearing the tracks of many small animals.
Overhead, the wooden rafters which support the leaky roof of the dwelling
creak and moan in the gentle breeze.  The only feature in the abandoned 
building appears to be a small alcove in the southern wall.  However, 
whatever once adorned the recess has long since disappeared.  It appears as 
though this dwelling will soon fall apart under its own weight and poor 
construction.  To the north lies a dark alley.

every liquer immaginable, some of which have been imported from the farthest
reaches of Faerun.  The patrons of this bar mostly keep to themselves, but 
seem well kept.  The only feature of the bar which seems strangely out of

walls here.  Constantly in a state of change and renewal, the city of 
Neverwinter often has dozens of such projects going on at the same time.  In
fact, as soon as a project is finished, there are usually one or two new 
projects starting up and, as such, a staff of craftsmen and workers is 
constantly employed by Lord Nashar to keep the city in good repair.  The 
walkway along the city walls continues north and south from here.

leads west from here to the docks of Neverwtiner. Like the other gates of 
the city, thes gates were made by the dwarves of Mithril Hall far to the 
north, these gates are made to withstand any attacks.  Since the risk of a
naval assault on Neverwinter is slight, the dock gates are left open most 
of the time.  However, in the event such an attack occurred, the gates 
could be closed off and staffed with armed guards in a matter of minutes. The
alcove overhead helps provide a measure of shelter to this place.  To the
east lies the Old Wharf Road around the western walls while the docks lie

some of the other, larger trees, were most likely planted by those 
responsible for the original laying of the road.  Even in their relative
youth, however, these trees have probably grown here for nearly a century.
The roar of the ocean breaking on the shores outside of Neverwinter can now

   This sparse room contains little more than a tiny table, a chair, and a

support the massive clock mechanism which can be heard ticking loudly 
overhead.  The small table and chair appear to be recently cleaned and likely
serve as a desk for whomever oversees the maintenance of the clock.  Over the

A Cluttered Alleyway~
   Debris covers the floor of this alleyway, apparently the remains of a
half-collapsed building to the east.  Large wooden beams and chunks of
stone block now almost block passage to the south and make footing in
the alleyway somewhat treacherous.  Squeaking sounds from beneath the 
rubble would seem to indicate that rats have taken up residence in the
remains of the building.  North of here, the alley appears to clear up
somewhat, while to the west, a doorway leads into a tall, tower-like
building.

&+yInside a Ruined Building&N~
   The remnants of this dwelling can hardly be called a building anymore. 
Only three of the original four walls still stand, and the only roof the
building has is the wide, grayish sky over Neverwinter.  Exactly what
happened to this building remains to be seen, but the northern warehouse
district is known for its aged buildings.  It's possible that time was the
culprit which brought this building down.  Judging by the whitened bones 
which occasionally protrude from the rubble, it looks as though the 
building may well have come down right on top of its previous occupants. An
alleyway strewn with debris lies to the west through a large pile of rubble.

&+LEntrance to the &+ROld Assassin's Guild&N~
   Much like the bar outside, this room is lavishly decorated.  The floors of
the room are covered in a thick, dark carpeting and the walls bear a rich,
wood paneling.  A large portrait of a dark figure predominates the northern
wall of the room, accompanied by a small brass plaque.  Although no visible
light source can be seen in the room, a dim light provides enough 
illumination to see clearly.  A larger chamber can be seen to the south, 
while a panel in the wall to the east appears more worn than the others.  In
ages past, this room served as the entryway to the local Assassin's Guild, but
political changes in the area have since forced its closing and many of its
members have since dispersed to other areas of the Realms.

   This room, much like the other rooms of the bar, is very well decorated.
Rich, polished wood and brash fixtures dominate the room.  Dim torches 
provide the only light in the room leaving the farthest corners in total
darkness.  Dark figures, seeming to merge with the shadows themselves are
seated at the various booths along the walls.  The floor in this room, like
the floors in the rest of the bar, appears to bear numerous dark stains on
its surface.  The only visible exit from the room is through the doorway
that leads to the main room of the bar.

than most of the others in the area.  The distinctive smell of fresh mead
and mulled wine fills the air through here, mingling with the fragrances from
the many plants along the street, and hinting at the nearness of a
brewery or large tavern.  Occasionally, silent figures can be seen strolling
casually amonst the trees and plants of the area, apparently lost in the
beauty and splendor of the city.  Garden Street continues both north and south through here.

below would seemingly preclude any chance of an attack from farther along

beginning again, closer to the northeastern gate of the city where the 
Neverwinter Wood nears the walls again.  The walkway along the city walls

famed Shining Serpent Inn.  Scattered about the room are various tables and 
booths at which sit a wide variety of travelers and adventurers, each with a 
tale to tell of their heroics.  Waitresses hurry about the room carrying 
trays laden with large tankards of ale and piled high with the large bowls of 
stew for which this inn is known.  Although some of the adventurers 
inhabiting this room look less than friendly, the mood of the room is very 
light-hearted and cheerful.  A broad, stone staircase leads upwards to the 
rooms of the inn while a broad doorway leads east into a quieter room which 
serves as the inn's bar.

   Unlike the boisterous and lively main room of the inn, the bar is much 
quieter and subdued.  The lighting in this room is quite a bit dimmer than in 
the main room, making it difficult to see into some of the far corners.  
Hushed conversations and sipped drinks make up a majority of the activity in 
this room.  The cautious and frequent glances of the occupants of the bar 
would seem to indicate that not all of the dealings here are above board.  A 
wide, polished marble bar lines the entire northern wall of this room, behind 
which are bottles of every imaginable potable in the realms.  A wide doorway 
leads west into the much louder and more active main room of the inn while a
smaller, less-noticeable door leads east to a smaller room.

items can be seen where careless passers by have tossed them.  Normally,
such small articles of litter would be quickly picked up and disposed of by
the street cleaners who constanly patrol the city.  In this case, it appears
as though this section of Garden Street has simply been skipped over or has
not been cleaned too recently.  South of here, lies the wide, bustling expanse

enourmous table on which a model of the city of Neverwinter and the 
surrounding areas has been placed.  The Kraken Compound is displayed most
prominantly in the city as a dark, purplish building of carved stone.  Oddly
enough, a very similar structure has been placed on the islands to the west 
of the city even though they have been thought to be largely uninhabited.

The potted plants appear to be some sort of miniature palm or fern.  Their
dense fronds give them a very bushy appearance.  Despite the gentle, lush
appearance of the plants in general, several large, thorny protrusions would
seem to advise against getting too close to them.

&+rUpper Level of the Clock Tower&N~
   The vast majority of the space on this level of the clock tower is taken
up by the massive clock machinery used to keep time.  Unlike the famous water
clocks of Neverwinter, this clock is a standard mechanical one.  The slow, 
rythmic ticking of the clock blends perfectly with the noise from the streets
below, forming a subtle symphony of activity.  Periodically, birds can be
heard flapping about in the rafters overhead and the thick, white layer of
droppings on the floor would seem to indicate that many spend a great deal of
time here.  A window looks out over the street to the west, while a stairway 
leads downward to the base of the tower.

   The loud, racous chatter of the lower level of the inn seems far removed
from this peaceful chamber.  Thick carpeting on the floors and many brightly
colored tapestries on the walls help to dampen the noise from the bar below 
so that weary travelers may find a quiet place to rest.  Several large, soft
chairs line the walls of the room, giving the inn a somewhat luxurious feel.  
The Inn of the Shining Serpent continues to the east from here while a

   This room, like the rest of the Inn, is very quiet.  Thick, luxurious
carpeting covers the floors, adding a degree of elegance to what is otherwise
a fairly average inn.  Although the bar below seems constantly occupied and
teeming with life, the inn itself is deserted.  Even the worker normally
present at the reception desk is absent, most likely enjoying the socializing
of the tavern below.  Despite the presence of the generally affluent citizens
of Neverwitner, this inn appears to see little business, possibly due to its
rates which tend to be a bit high for the average traveler of the north.  A
larger room lies to the west of here.

The Trophy Room~
   The contents of this room could best be described as trophies.  While some
of the pieces may qualify as pieces of art or genuine artifacts, the majority
would seem to be generally worthless and of only sentimental value.  Included
among the pieces displayed on the walls are several old, battered weapons, a
delapidated suit of armor, and a few portraits of individuals in adventuring
gear.  It is quite possible that this home belongs to one of the old 
adventurers of the north who has decided to make Neverwinter their home in 
their old age.  A doorway leads east from here to the rest of the dwelling.

of this room has chosen more common pieces of local folk art.  Scenes of
nearby landmarks and portraits of the Neverwinter Wood would seem to be a

patrolling atop the walls here, ever vigilant against the threat of an attack
from hostile Luskan to the north.  In the hundreds of years of the history of
the city, the walls have never been successfully breached, but Lord Nasher
and his guards take no chances in their defense of the citizenry.  The stone

coverings so as to be ready at a moments notice.  Although attacks on the
city have become less frequent in past years, the presence of hostile
Luskan to the north means the city must prepare for the worst at all times.

   The roar of the relentless waves of the Trackless Sea crashing on the

far to the west as the eye can see, the Trackless Sea boils and churns
from the constant winds of the north.  Dotting the horizon to the west, a
small chain of islands can be seen, jutting precariously above the
surface of the water.  Southwest of here, Neverwinter's naturally calm
harbor provides respite to the trading ships who traverse these waters as
they move their goods from market to market.  The walkway atop the city
walls continues to the north and south.

east, the vast Neverwinter Wood stands like a menacing green wall around the
city.  Although the regions of the Wood near the city are relatively safe,
many dark dangers are said to await within the deeper reaches of the forest.
The city guards who patrol the walls through here are constantly on the 
lookout for any threats to the city which may emerge from the depths of the
Wood.  The walkway along the city walls continues north and east from here.

some of the city's archers protected vantage points from which to fire.
Although attacks are infrequent as of late, several scarred areas of the
walls and the evidence of repair work would seem to indicate that at least
a few attempts on the city have been defended from here.  The stone path of

   Small pools of water have collected in the low areas of the stone 
walkway through here, indicating a recent storm.  Frequent weather changes
are quite common in the city of Neverwinter due to its location in the 
north and its proximity to the sometimes chaotic Trackless Sea.  Although 
the seasons can be harsh in this area, the sturdy stone walls of Neverwinter
have handled the wear and tear successfully for centuries.  Thanks in part
to the constant repairs and improvements made on the walls, it is quite 
possible that they will stand for several more centuries.  The walkway

   A thin, wispy mist hangs in the air here.  The cool breeze combined with
the churning waters of the Trackless Sea below often create thick fogs which
can cover the city in a gray, cottony blanket.  Far off in the water, the
bells of warning bouys can be heard, clanking as they rock in the waves of 
the sea.  The rocky waters of the Trackless Sea near Neverwinter have claimed
many strong ships with their jagged outcroppings and such bouys have been
placed by Lord Nashar to avert as many naval disasters as possible.  The

   The wide, flat rooftops of the city create a relatively level walkway
through here.  Most are covered with dull, grayish shingles made of slate
or a similar stone.  Here and there where water has gathered on the rooftops,
the footing can become somewhat treacherous, but the travel on the roofs is
relatively easy going.  From the looks of things, at least a few individuals 
have used these rooftops for traveling above the streets of the city, only
their purpose remains to be seen.  The rooftops continue south from here

stood for ages near the shore of the Trackless Sea, but the constant pounding
of the waters and range of climate in the north have clearly taken their 
toll.  Here and there, marks have been drawn on the blocks, indicating 
direction and degree of sag.  It would appear that the city engineers have
already been alerted to the problems of the walls here, and are likely 
working on a solution or organizing repairs.  The walkway along the city

larger thoroughfares of the city.  To the west of here, across the gap 
created by the streets lies a massive structure with barred windows.  
Although the building appears to have been a warehouse at one time, it now

steep as to inhibit travel.  From the ill-repair of the slate shingles here 
and there and the large, rather featureless nature of the roof itself, it

in northern Neverwinter, warehouses actually make up a majority of the 
buildings around here.  The stone roofs of the city continue to the north,

   Bird droppings have accumulated to almost unnatural proportions on
certain areas of this roof.  Several small, squat chimneys apparently
provide popular roosts for some of Neverwinter's plentiful supply of
pigeons.  The slope of the roof gently lowers from east to west here, 
leading downwards toward the broad expanse of the Wyrmfrost Road.  The
rooftops above the city streets continue both to the east and to the
south from here.

&+BOn the Rooftops of &+WNeverwinter&N~
   A rickey, wooden expanse of planks and old wooden shingles forms
the surface of the roof here.  Clearly not in good repair, the surface
of the roof here creaks and groans with the added weight of people
crossing its surface.  Large holes in the roof allow a limited view of
the ruined, delapidated contents of the rooms of the building below.  The
rooftops of the city continue to the west while yet another series of
rickety plank walkways spans a small alleyway to the east.

&+yA Wooden Walkway Between Buildings&N~
   More wooden planks span the dizzying space above the surface of a
small street or alleyway through here.  The height of the buildings
above the surface of the pavement below adds an element of risk to 
traversing such a narrow walkway, but such danger does not seem to
have deterred too many people judging by the worn surface of the planks.  
Wide, flat rooftops of the city lie both east and west of here.

&+LA Delapidated Rooftop&N~
   Rotten shingles and great gaps in the roof show that this building is in 
dire need of major repairs.  The rafters supporting the roof, or what's left
of the roof, creak and groan under even the slightest amount of weight.  It
is almost amazing that the roof of the building has held together as much as
it has considering the amount of visible rot and water damage to the wood.  
To both the west and south, narrow walkways have been constructed of wooden 
planks which span alleys surrounding the building.

&+gThe Walkway Along the &+LCity Walls&N~
   The clamor of the streets of Neverwinter can be heard throughout the area
here.  Even during the darkest evening, the city glows and resounds with life
and activity.  Although the northern warehouse districts of Neverwinter tend
to be less affluent than those areas near Castle Never, the citizens who make
the area their home still enjoy a high standard of living compared to other
cities in the Realms.  The walkway along the city walls continues both north 
and south.

&+LA Tiny, Hidden Shop&N~
   Hidden among the rooftops of Neverwinter, this shop is probably the
most esoteric in town.  Either the owner of the shop is extremely fond
of his solitude, or the nature of his wares is somewhat less than
legitamite.  Few adornments of any kind cover the rough wood of the
shop walls.  The only real furnishings of the small room are a simple
wooden counter and a few rickety chairs placed around a delapidated 
table.

&+yAn End to the Walkway&N~
   The narrow walkway above the streets of Neverwinter comes to an abrupt end
here in the face of a building.  The wooden planks of the walkway have been
securly anchored to a narrow ledge on the building to the west, but further
construction appears to have ended.  It is quite possible that the city
guard or other city officials noticed the unauthorized construction of the
walkway and put an end to it before any more of the walkway could be 
finished.  The narrow walkway of planks continues to the east from here.

&+yAlong A Narrow Walkway&N~
   The narrow walkway of wooden planks above the rooftops of the city 
continues through here.  Although the construction appears quite old and
rickety, the manner in which the planks are supported across their spans is
actually quite sturdy.  The narrowness of the path requires a great deal of
agility and nimbleness to maneuver successfully, but from the looks of the
walkway, many individuals manage to pass here nonetheless.  The wooden
walkway continues both north and west from here.

   The wooden planks of the walkway sway slightly in the breeze here as they
cross a narrow, dark alleyway.  Although the construction of the planks is
very piecemeal, close attention has been paid to provide the necessary 
supports at critical connections, possibly indicating that this construction
is not as amateur as it first appears.  The walkway of planks connects two
rooftops here to the north and east.

A Rooftop Above The Tavern~
   The low, slightly pitched rooftop of the tavern stretches out through
here.  A small trapdoor in the roof allows passage between the rooftop here 
and the interior of the tavern.  The slate shingles of the rooftop can be
somewhat slippery, but provide an adequate foothold for the nimble.  To the
west from here, a narrow wooden walkway has been constructed which leads
off to other rooftops in the city.  Upon a quick scan of the surrounding
area, an entire network of such walkways can be seen throughout the
neighboring portion of the city.

&+gThe End of the&+L Walkway&N~
   South of here, the northern dock gates of Neverwinter rise up and form an
impenetrable wall of stone.  The guards who patrol the walls south of here 
are maintained by the dock authority and thus are a wholly seperate entity
from the city guards who patrol the walls through here.  Although the walkway
along the city walls comes to an end here, the rooftops of Neverwinter 
stretch off to the east from here.  From the looks of a slightly worn path
across the rooftops, it appears as though several individuals have already
discovered this route and use it somewhat frequently.  The walkway along
the city walls continues to the north from here.

&+BOn the Rooftops of &+WNeverwinter&N~
   Here, just apart from the walkway along the city walls, the rooftops
of Neverwinter are flat enough to allow passage.  Although the majority
of the rooftops in town are steeply pitched to avoid gathering too much
snow during Neverwinter's harsh winters, the rooftop here is relatively
level.  Perhaps because of this and its proximity to the walkway along
the city walls, this portion of rooftop has a small walkway worn on
its surface.  The rooftops continue to the east while the walkway atop
the city walls lies just to the west.

&+BOn the Rooftops of &+WNeverwinter&N~
   The rooftops of Neverwinter stretch out as far as the eye can see
from here.  The majority of the buildings in the city are short,
average appearing structures, but a few can be seen which can only 
be described as majestic.  Minor keeps, towers, mansions, and even
the enormous outline of Castle Never can be seen from this vantage
point.  Altough just a roof, from the worn path on its surface, it
appears as through this particular area also serves as a pathway
of some kind.  The rooftops of the city continue to the west while
a narrow, rickety plank spans a street to the south.

&+yA Narrow Walkway Above Wharf Road&N~
   Someone has created a makeshift pathway between the rooftops of
two buildings here by placing a long, narrow plank between them.  It
appears as though the walkway is intended to be somewhat permanent as
both ends have been securely nailed down, but the narrowness of the
planks and poor manner in which the walkway was constructed clearly
marks this as an unofficial improvement to the area and, if noticed
by the city guard, it will most likely be taken down.  Far below, the
paved surface of Old Wharf Road threatens menacingly to any unlucky
enough to fall.

&+wThird Level of the &+GShining Serpent&N&+w Inn&N~
   The staircase of the Shining Serpent Inn pauses here at the third
floor as it continues its upward journey through the building.  Clearly
more decorative than the first two floors of the inn, the furnishings
in this entryway are clearly of a fine quality.  Wonderfully colored
tapestries line the walls, depicting scenes from Neverwinter's past
while stained glass windows bathe the room in a myriad of colors.  A
long, quiet hallways leads to the east from here, towards several of the
quiet rooms of the Shining Serpent.  The staircase itself leads up and
down from here.

&+wA Hallway in the &+GShining Serpent&N&+w Inn&N~
   This wood paneled hallway features sea-green carpet, which drowns out 
nearly all of the sounds from the rowdy tavern on the first floor.  
Lacking any windows, the hallway becomes quit dim, but several doorways 
leading off into rooms of the inn can be made out, cleverly patterned 
after the style of the wood paneling itself so as to blend in and 
maintain a consistant look for all of the rooms.  At the east end of the 
hallway, a room has been left open, and light can be seen coming through 
the open doorway, helping to illuminate the dim hallway.  The main 
staircase of the inn lies just to the west of here.

&+wA Bright Room in the &+GShining Serpent&N&+w Inn&N~
   This room is brightly lit by a combination of natural light 
flooding in through a number of wide windows and several magical
lanterns that have been strategically placed on several small tables
and stands around the room.  Thick, velvet curtains have been neatly
tied with decorative cords to allow light and a light breeze to
flow in through the large windows.  Faint sounds from the streets
below and the smell of freshly baked bread are carried into the room
by the cool air.  This room clearly serves as one of the more
opulent rooms of the inn, and likely costs quite a bit more than the
average traveler would be willing to pay.  A dimly lit hallway leads
to the west from here.

&+wThe Fourth Floor of the &+GShining Serpent&N&+w Inn&N~
   Much like the entryway of the third floor, this room is very well
decorated with tapestries and stained glass windows.  Here and there,
golden light fixtures have been affixed to the walls and may serve as
holders for magical lanterns during the long, dark nights that are
common during the winters of the north.  Two, unadorned doorways lead
north and east from here, presumably to additional rooms of the inn.
Like the light fixtures, the hinges and locks of the two doors appear
to be made of gold, possibly indicating that these rooms are reserved
for special guests at the inn, rather than the average traveler.  The
faint sounds of the tavern on the first floor can still be heard here,
echoing up through the open stairway that leads back down to the third
floor.

&+wAn Opulent Room in the &+GShining Serpent&N&+w Inn&N~
   This room is lavishly decorated and adorned with delicate and
finely made furnishings.  The normally wooden floors of the rest of
the inn have been replaced with a combination of parquet wood and
polished marble.  In the very center of the room, the floor has been
covered with a thick, warm carpet made of a very thick and soft
material.  Several fine chairs stand near the windows of the room,
offering a wide view of the city skyline.  In addition to several
smaller couches and other furniture, a large polster bed set with
soft, silken sheets stands near a marble fireplace set in the eastern
wall of the room.  While everything in the room appears well cared
for and clean, it is doubtful that this room is occupied very often,
even in a city as well-to-do as Neverwinter.  A thick, wooden door
leads to the south from here.

&+wA Small Room in the &+GShining Serpent&N&+w Inn&N~
   This room, as opposed to many of the other guest rooms in the
tavern, is actually quite small and humble.  The furniture of the
room is well-made, but the upholstery has clearly seen better days.
In addition, in contrast to the normally large, thick beds of the
rest of the inn, the bed in this room appears rather plain.  It is
quite possible that this room serves as a servants' quarters for
any members of an entourage traveling with more important or wealthy
guests staying in the inn.  Despite its location on the highest level
of the inn, the windows in this room are relatively small and the
view of the city through them is somewhat unimpressive.  A small
doorway leads to the west from here.
