Original files for the city of Neverwinter and surrounding Neverwinter wood zones that I originally worked on and slated for release on the TorilMUD (ex-Sojourn, etc.) MUD back in the mid-to-late 90's.  Pretty fleshed out in terms of mobs, descriptions, connections to the main MUD, items, quest chains, storyline, etc. - all in their original ASCII colored, plain text glory.  ...just never quite had the time to finish.  Maybe some day.
