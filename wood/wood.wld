&+GAn Intersection in the &N&+cHigh Road&N~
   The High Road passes through the dark Neverwinter Wood around the City
of Neverwinter.  The road shows evidence of a great deal of travel, but 
the forest surrounding it looks as though it could overgrow the road at 
any time. Strange noises both animal and otherwise can be heard 
periodically coming from the woods.  Rumors abound about treasures and
terrors alike which can be found within the forest, but very few 
adventurers who go in search of them ever return.  The High Road continues
its mute trek through the forest to the north while the enormous northern
gates of Neverwinter lie to the south.

&+GThe &N&+cHigh Road&+G Around &+WNeverwinter&N~
   This particular stretch of the road is bordered to the south by sharp
drop-off into the warm, blue waters of the Neverwinter River. On the opposite
banks of the river can be seen the aged stone walls of Neverwinter where the
colorful banners for the city of Neverwinter wave lazily in the breeze. To
the north of the road, dark and foreboding Neverwinter Wood forms a dense and
treacherous wall of foliage stretching as far as the eye can see. The High
Road continues east and west through here.

&+GThe &N&+cHigh Road&+G Around &+WNeverwinter&N~
   As the road heads through this portion of the woods, the roar from the
nearby Neverwinter River becomes almost deafening.  Likely due to the
closeness of the river, thick, lush moss covers the trees and ground
throughout this area, blanketing the area in a soft, green carpet.  The
light breeze which occasionally blows through here brings with it a rich,
earthy smell.  The High road continues both east and west through here.

   The High Road passes through the dark Neverwinter Wood as it heads around
the city of Neverwinter. This particular stretch of the road is bordered to
the south by a sharp and rocky drop-off into the ever warm, blue waters of
the Neverwinter River. On the opposite banks of the river can be seen the
weather-worn walls of Neverwinter which show need for repair in many places.
Were it not for the boundary provided by the river, it seems as though the
rabid growth of the forest would easily overtake the city walls.  The High
Road continues east and west through here.

   The High Road passes through the dark Neverwinter Wood around the City of
Neverwinter. On both sides of the road stand the edges of the dark and
dangerous Neverwinter Wood.  Strange cries echo from deep inside its dark
pathways and the occasional unidentifiable shadow flits through the trees
just beyond the safety of the road.  The road is wide through here, but even
during the brightest times of the day, little light reaches ground here.  The
High Road curves through the woods to both the east and west.

   The darkness around the High Road grows somewhat deeper through here as
the forest seems to encroach even further.  Despite the well-tended
appearance of the road, this area has a very wild and uncontrolled feel to
it.  Rustling in the bushes and trees around the road shows signs of life,
but none of the denizens of this dark area ever make themselves visible.

Road passes through this section of the Neverwinter Wood.  Although little
can be seen through the dense trees surrounding the road, the occasional
subtle movement of the bushes and the quiet rustle of leaves and grass 
lends to the impression that something is definitely there.  The High Road

   The rambling path of the High Road curves slightly through the woods as it
passes through here, severely hindering the view of the trail both ahead and
behind.  A slight wind occasionally rustles the leaves of the trees overhead,
breaking the serene calm of the area only slightly.  Periodically, a stale
smell drifts through the air something akin to dry, rotting leaves and other
foliage.  The High Road continues both east and west from here on its never
ending journey across the land.

   The sudden, piercing calls of strange beasts echo from deeper in the wood
as the pathway narrows slightly through here.  The normally well-kept High
Road seems to be in need of some upkeep in this area as potholes and larger
rocks mar its surface.  Unfortunately, with the less-than friendly ambiance
of this place it would seem to reason that a repair crew will be a long time
in coming.  Only the bravest of adventurers and the ever-vigilant Harpers
dare to travel these pathways in these dark times.  The High Road continues

   The High Road continues its shadowy trek through the foreboding 
Neverwinter Wood through here.  The dense, overhead foliage of the Wood
prevents a great deal of light from reaching the ground which keeps the 
pathway of the road somewhat cooler and darker here than farther to the
south.  Despite the relative closeness to the city of Neverwinter, this 
area is still very wild and untamed.  The High Road continues both to the

   The High Road widens slightly through here as it makes its way through the
Neverwinter Wood.  On occasion, small woodland creatures can be seen foraging
for food in the bushes alongside the road.  Although very common in most of
the forests of the north, it is rare to see the small denizens of the
Neverwinter Wood due to the dense foliage and many dangerous predators which
tend to thin out their numbers.  Were it not for the dangerous reputation of
the forest surrounding the trail, this area may well seem peaceful and
relaxing.  The High Road curves through the woods to both the east and west.

&+bThe End of the Neverwinter River&N~
   The warm Neverwinter River floats lazily through here as it makes its way
to the Trackless Sea.  The water laps gently on the shore, granting this area
a peaceful and relaxed feeling.  Here and there, a smooth, moss-covered rock
can be seen poking through the surface and frogs can be heard chirping and
singing from the shallows near the forest.  As the river ends to the west,
the great expanse of the Trackless Sea can be seen extending as far as the

the river means they pose little threat to even the smallest of vessels.  
Occasionally, small, unidentifiable lizards can be seen sunning themselves on
rocks near the shore. On the south bank of the river, the great northern
walls of Neverwinter can be seen looming at sharp, right angles against the
sky.  The river flows from east to west through here.

   The tireless and ancient Neverwinter River flows west through here as it
makes its way to the Trackless Sea.  On occasion, seagulls can be seen slowly
gliding overhead, attesting to the nearness of the Trackless Sea.  North of
here, a muddy bank meets sharp, rocky cliffs which lead up to the Neverwinter
Wood.  In ages past, the level of the river was likely much higher than now,
but the ceaseless flow of the warm waters has gradually eroded its way down
through the thick, gray granite which lays under the entire area.  To the
south, the river is bordered by the great northern walls of Neverwinter which
have clearly seen better days.

&+bAlong the Neverwinter River&N~
   Tiny eddies and swirls in the surface of the river lightly churn the water
as it flows through here to the Trackless Sea.  Although the river is
relatively low at present, in past years, flooding has raised the water high
enough so as to allow large vessels to come as far inland as the northern
gates of Neverwinter.  Light winters in the mountains far to the north in
recent years are likely to blame for the currently low levels, although no
one knows for sure from where the Neverwinter river draws its waters.

   Although the Neverwinter River is used quite frequently by small craft for
trafficking goods from the Trackless Sea to inland caravans, the exact source
of the river still remains a mystery.  Theories about the source of the river
range from dark, ancient magics to a simple, underground spring.  Several
parties of adventurers have departed on expeditions to determine the source
of the continually warm waters, but none have ever returned.  For now,
though, the mysterious waters of the Neverwinter River stretch to the east
and west from here.

   As the Neverwinter River emerges from beneath the bridge leading to the
nothern gates of Neverwinter, its waters continue their lazy journey to the
Trackless Sea.  Here and there, small drop-offs create minor rapids in the
river, but the rapids don't pose any threat to even the smallest of craft.
To the south, the looming walls of Neverwinter hang over the river, creating
small, shaded pools where fish occasionally jump as they attempt to catch
their next meal.  The nearness of the city and the civilization that comes
with it likely contributes to the amount of garbage which can be seen
floating in the water here and there.

   This portion of the Neverwinter river is shaded by the great northern

pillars are sunk deep into the river bed to help support the mass of stone
above.  The water here is somewhat stagnant and polluted with garbage thrown
from the bridge overhead by careless adventurere and merchants.  Amongst the
filth floats the occasional dead fish or unidentifiable portion of animal
which lends a foul odor to this particular area of the river.  The river
flows sluggishly from east to west through here.

The rocky cliffs to the north are water-soaked and covered with lichens and
moss which grow easily in the misty air just below the falls.  To the south,
the river is a little more turbulent as the river flows through some larger
rapids at the base of the waterfalls.  West of here, the water flows through
a series of smaller and less turbulent rapids as it gradually calms on its
trek to the Trackless Sea.

   Here the Neverwinter river is much calmer and forms a marshy area.  Clumps
of reeds sprout from the water near the shore and force travelers to abandon
their rafts and wade through the slimy water.  Larger fish flip from the
water here and there in an attempt to reach the numerous flying insects which
buzz annoying in large swarms over the water.  Occasionally, a large swirl in
the water attests to larger creatures staying out of sight beneath the murky
surface of the river.  There is a path to the east of here while the river

occasion.  Large, rounded rocks abound in this area, many of which are
covered with ancient lichens and moss.  Here and there, a recently-felled
tree also attests to the presence of at least a few beavers on this stretch
of the river.  To the west, the Neverwinter River bends through the forest

extent.  This area seems to be covered mostly by smaller, sapling trees,
indicating an area of relatively new growth.  The dark, moss-covered ground
underfoot is pretty moist through this area, and smaller, marshy areas can be
seen just off of the path.  The path continues deeper into the forest to the

occasionally scurry about in the foliage in their quest for nourishment.  The

Taken individually, the trees are no different than those anywhere else in

malformed trees.  Tortured cries seem to echo from deep inside the woods but
it is impossible to identify them as belonging to man or beast.  In contrast
to the broad, paved roadways to the south, the mighty High Road narrows
through here and amounts to little more than a well-worn path.  The road can

   The dark pathway through the forest begins to widen considerably through
here.  The grayish stones along the sides of the road are now several feet
tall and intricately carved with scenes of death and battle.  Whomever or
whatever placed these stones took a great deal of time in placing them.  Even
the apparently long time they've spent unattended in the forest has had
little effect on them.  Bits of lichen cling to the rocks in places, but
their surface remains largely uncovered.  The trees through here are
abnormally twisted in appearance and the frost on the ground appears to be
growing more prevalent.  The path heads into a small clearing east of here
and plunges back into the forest to the west.

   High stone blocks mark the outline of an abandoned shrine that once
dominated this small clearing.  Many of the pillars which once supported the
roof appear to have collapsed long ago and the shrine now lies in ruins.
Lichen cover the massive blocks in many places, but are held at bay by the
thin, unnatural coating of frost which blankets the area.  Occasionally,
tracks of some large creature can be seen in the frost, but are not clear
enough to identify.  The large stone altar in the centar of the shrine seems 
almost ludicrously large and one must wonder what exactly was sacrificed 
here. The path continues west into the forest and east behind the shrine.

their mass.  Sharp shards of rock line the ground, but remain covered by a
thin coating of frost in the places hidden from the sun.  The ground here has
been disturbed a great deal and it appears as though a large beast or beasts
pass through here frequently.  The bone-numbing chill continues to hang in

&+bNear Rapids on the Neverwinter River&N~
   The warm, majestic waters of the Neverwinter River flow softly along the
shore through here.  Although the rocks which occasionally protrude from the
water are somewhat sharp and treacherous looking, they do not pose a danger
to any but the smallest and weakest of canoes.  To the south and west, the
river is bordered by the great northern walls of the city of Neverwinter.  To
the north the water is quite turbulent as the lazy flow of the river turns
into churning rapids.

&+bNear Rapids on the Neverwinter River&N~
   A small pool has formed on the river here as the rapids on the river begin
to even out.  The water here is very dark and the pool which extends north
and west appears as though it is very deep.  South of here, the waters of the
pool are bordered by the long, northern walls of Neverwinter.  East, up the
flow of the river, the water is quite turbulent as the river flows down from
a series of waterfalls and turns to rapids.

&+bNear Rapids on the Neverwinter River&N~
   The waters of the Neverwinter River begin to calm here somewhat as they
leave the rapids to the east and flow towards a small pool of sorts to the
west.  Long grasses and reeds line the banks to the north, attesting to the
relaxed flow of the waters and allowing some wildlife to take a foothold.
Birds can be seen flitting between the reeds hunting for insects and
protecting their nests.  East of here, the water is quite turbulent as the
warm river is churned by rapids and waterfalls.

   The Neverwinter River flows turbulently through this area.  Large and
dangerous-looking rocks poke through the surface making any navigation of
this portion of the river extremely treacherous.  In the calmer pools, small
pieces of what look to be the remains of small rafts have accumulated,
attesting to the danger of the river and the misfortune of previous
travelers.  The rapids continue to the south in the form of waterfalls,
preventing any attempt to move upstream.  The river looks calmer west of

&+LAn Incline in the Trail&N~
   The pathway through the woods winds along the river past here.  The ground
is very soft due to the proximity of the water, but the thick, almost carpet-
like moss which covers the area helps keep footing somewhat firm.  Reeds grow
alongside the water in the shallows, and frogs hop about chasing insects.
Every now and then, a turtle can be seen sunning itself on a rock in the
river.  The path here does not look like it sees too much use, but evidence
of past traffic is evident.  The path continues south along the river and
north where it heads back into the woods.

   This path is hard to make out through the thick bushes and thickets of the
forest.  Although the trail does not appear to get much use, here and there a
freshly-broken branch indicates some fairly recent use.  The dense
underbrush, combined with the tall, dark trees makes this area very gloomy.
Rustling can be heard all around this area, and once and a while, a small
chipmunk or rabbit will dart across the path.  The path continues to the

Neverwinter on the shores of the glittering Trackless Sea.  To the west, the
hill drops off in a short, but steep and rocky cliff.  Peering over the edge,
the outline of the High Road can be seen poking through the trees here and
there as it slowly winds its way through the forest.  Far to the north, the 
Spine of the World can barely be seen on the horizon.  The path slopes down

darkness of the forest is somewhat abated as more light is able to filter
through to the ground.  Birds singing from the trees and the chattering of
squirrels as they race about almost makes this an almost peaceful area.  The

quite believable.  The trail winds east and west through here as it makes

   A hush has fallen over this area of the woods as the trail continues to
weave between the trees into the depths of the Neverwinter Wood.  The brush
is dense here, and appears very thorny and uninviting.  Small animals peek
out from the underbrush on occasion, but largely remain out of sight.  A
strange smell occasionally wafts through the air, reminiscent of rot and
decay.  Large tracks of some kind can also be seen on the ground, indicating
the occasional presence of larger creatures.  The trail winds east and west.

   The warm waters of the Neverwinter River continue their turbulent passage
through this area.  The constant churning of the water creates a light mist
which hangs permanently in the air here.  In places, large logs and pieces of
wood can be seen lodged against the dangerous rocks of the rapids.  The
series of rapids continue to the north of here while travel south is barred
by sharp dropoff from the waterfalls above.  The looming and moss-covered
walls of the city of Neverwinter stand above the river to the west.

   As the path heads upwards and follows the river south through here, the
water to the west becomes more and more turbulent.  Here and there,
waterfalls span the river below, churning up mist and making travel along the
river very treacherous.  As the path heads south, it gradually slopes uphill
and grows more rocky.  On occasion, the path takes on a near-vertical slope,
and forces one to partially climb up the slippery rocks in an effort to
continue.  Here and there, snakes slither in and out of the grasses near
shore, but other animal life is scarce.  The path continues both north and

of the forest seems somewhat duller here and the occasional dead tree stands
like an old skeleton portending death to others.  The only vegetation which
seems healthy is the long, danglimg moss which hangs down from the withering
branches overhead.  The High road continues east and west from here.

seen farther off into the forest.  Many of the stones are covered with a thin
layer of grayish-green lichens.  In the shady area between some of the larger

   Emerging from a seemingly impassible thicket to the north, the trail
continues slightly through here.  Clearly, this secluded stretch has not seen
use in years and is nearly reclaimed by the forest.  A small shelter has been
constructed here, but no longer provides much of a refuge from the elements.
A whitened skeleton, still wearing bits of rotted armor, lies half-buried in
the dirt, most likely telling the fate of the shelter's last inhabitant.
Sounds of larger creatures crashing about seem to come from all around here,
adding to the evil feel of the place.  The path appears to continue to the

difficult, but dangerous as well.  The mist in the air here is very thick, 
and greatly limits visibility to perhaps a dozen meter, adding to the peril 
of navigation.  The rapids of the river continue over a steep waterfall to 
the north of here, while a much calmer pool lies south.

&+LA High Rocky Point on the Trail&N~
   As the path continues upwards, it grows rockier and more treacherous.
Winding high above the river, the path alters its north-south heading and
turns towards the east.  The path through here is barely discernable as it
weaves through large, sharp rocks.  Here and there, the cliff on which the
path passes seems to have broken up from age and frost, and dark crevices
prevent progress.  Moss and lichens cling to everything, and other than one
or two small trees growing out over the river, other vegetation is sparse.
On the banks below to the south, a small, calm pool opens up on the river
atop the rapids.  The path continues north and east, where it appears to
slope downwards slightly and re-enter the woods.

from the water itself, access to the pool is effectively blocked.  The trail

end.  Tall trees shroud the area in shadows for the majority of the day and a
wall of thick brambles prevents travel any deeper into the forest.  Animals
can be heard scampering about in the brush, but none ever emerge from their
hiding places.  A bird or two will periodically flit through the air, but
this place is eerily silent.  Sounds come from deeper within the wood and
bring up memories regarding the dark tales of the creatures that lurk in its
depths.  The trail heads west from here.

trail becomes obscured in the thick undergrowth.  South of here, the trail

&+GThe &N&+cHigh Road &+GThrough Neverwinter Wood&N~
   The High Road here is well traveled and well kept.  Serving as the main
connection between the southern lands and the Savage North, the High Road is
often cluttered with travelers and merchants.  Here and there, remains of a
campfire can be seen just off of the side of the road, but none of them look
too recent.  Large rocks, covered with lichens and moss, also line the side
of the road and were likely cleared out by the Harpers who patrol the area,
keeping the peace. The High Road continues west and south.

&+LA Beaten Path Through the Forest&N~
   As the path makes its way through the Neverwinter Wood, the trees begin to
take on a more sinister look.  It is clear that this area sees less traffic
than the High Road as thick grasses are beginning to sprout through the
packed earth of the trail.  Here and there, a log alongside of the road
provides a place to sit and rest, but the uneasy feeling of the area would
seem to warn against such a rest stop.  The path through the forest continues
north and south.

&+BA Murky Dead End in the Trail&N~
   The hidden trail through the forest comes to an abrupt halt here.  The
dark trees here bear the scars of great claw marks and the underbrush is
trampled and broken.  Large, unidentifiable imprints in the ground tell of
the passing of some great creature, but exactly what that being may have been
remains to be seen.  Perhaps the horrid tales of the beasts that live within
the Neverwinter Wood have more basis in fact than most suspect.  This place
has an evil feel to it.

&+bA Small Pool on the Neverwinter River&N~
   Just atop some falls, the Neverwinter River forms a relatively calm pool.
The water here, despite the slight current, has a almost glass-like surface.
Willows hang over the water near shore and contrast sharply with the tall
and twisted trees of the rest of the Neverwinter Wood.  The chirping birds,
croaking frogs, and buzzing of various insects adds a very calming feeling to
this area.  Despite its close proximity to the city of Neverwinter, this pool
seems almost untouched.  The looming and moss-covered walls of the City of
Neverwinter stand above the pool to the west, while north, some steep
waterfalls lead down rapids on the Neverwinter River.

   Surrounded on all sides by nearly impenetrable trees, this area seems to
have been secluded for some time.  Despite its remote location, this tiny
glade does have some evidence that it has been used in the past.  Here
and there are the signs of previous campfires and shelters.  Tattered
remnants of clothing and whitened bones protruding from the moist soil attest
to more violent occurrences here.  From the trees surrounding this area 
come the occasional sounds of a larger animal making its way through the

   Here, a muddy stretch of the bank allows access to the Neverwinter River.
The area looks as though it serves more often as a watering hole for
wandering deer than as a dock for adventurers, but it still serves its
purpose.  Thick mist hangs around the area and obscures most of the view, the
outline of a rocky island can be seen to the south, across the river.  The
sound of birds from the trees add a calming affect to this area, which feels
relatively peaceful compared to the rest of the forest.  A narrow path

   Even in the darkest areas of the Neverwinter Wood, it seems that beauty
can be found. Alongside the path here, small, violet flowers bloom in the
shade.  Deep thickets of bushes to the west also bear large, blueish berries.
The untouched status of the berries seems strange in a forest with so much
wildlife and appears to indicate that the natural denizens of the forest
refrain from eating the lovely fruit. The High Road continues north and east

   The High Road bends lazily southward through here.  This particular area
is fairly open, and appears to serve as something of a stopping grounds for
weary travelers.  Most of the trees have been cleared out through here, but
the Neverwinter Wood never ends its assault to retake the area and overgrow
the road.  Occasionally, strange noises can be heard coming from the woods
around this place, but there is still something of a feeling of security
about it.  In the very least, anything emerging from the wood would have to
cross relatively open terrain which would give travelers some advanced
warning.  The High Road continues west and south from here.  To the east is a
small path leading off through the woods.

Appearing to get a good deal of traffic, the path, though obviously not as
well-traveled as the High Road, is clearly defined as it makes its way
through the forest here.  In this area, the remnants of many campfires can be
seen, indicating that this crossing of the paths also serves as something of
a campsite for weary travelers.  The path in the forest continues north and

to the city.  The majority of the refuse, however, appears to have been 
collected in piles on the shore.  Rustling under the various piles attests to 
the presence of rats or other vermin, but none ever make their appearance.  
The smell of the refuse is unpleasant, but not unbearable with the constant 
fresh breeze over the pond.  The pool continues east and north where the

Large, drooping willows border the shores along the northern edge of the pool
while the great walls of Neverwinter border to the south.  The pools waters
are very inviting and clear.  In the depths of the pool can be seen large
outcroppings of rock and leftover stone from the building of Neverwinter's
walls.  large schools of fish can also be seen swimming in and out of the

animals which use the river for food.  Small swarms of insects also make this
place their home, hovering just over the surface of the water and constantly
annoying passing travelers.  Farther to the north, in the dark and fearsome
expanse of the deep forest, darkers sounds can be heard, serving as a
constant reminder of the dangers of this area, despite its apparent beauty.

smooth with time can be seen periodically poking through the surface of the

larger prey which venture too close to the surface of the water.  The slight
breeze which blows through here is lightly scented by some of the wildflowers
growing on the banks.  The powdery seeds of cattails also litter the air like

their heads out of their tunnels to get a look around.  In this largely open
area, clumps of bushes help provide shelter for the smaller creatures of the

Neverwinter.  A slight fog hangs in the air here, and seems to originate from
the rocky island.

&+bA Bend in the Neverwinter River&N~
   The Neverwinter River curves through the woods here as it makes its way to
a more open area to the west.  This stretch of river is almost constantly
shaded by the large, overhanging trees of the Neverwinter Wood.  The lazy
flow of the river would likely grant this area a very serene feeling were it
not for its proximity to the dangerous and foreboding Neverwinter Wood.  The
river flows from the south towards the west from here.

&+gA Narrow Overgrown Path&N~
   The narrow path bends through the woods here beneath the thick canopy of
the trees.  Painful looking thickets of thorn bushes line both sides of the
path through here and leave little option as to which directions travel is
allowed.  The faint sound of running water attests to the nearness of the
Neverwinter River, although no sign of the river itself can be seen though
the dense foliage.  To the north, the path seems to open up slightly into a
clearing in the forest.  East of here, the narrow pathway continues its trek
through the forest.

&+gA Narrow Overgrown Path&N~
   This path is hardly visible among the bushes and thickets of the forest.
Appearing, perhaps, to be an animal trail more than anything else, it wanders
haphazardly about between the trees.  The dense underbrush, combined with the
thick foliage of the trees makes this area very dark, even during midday.
Rustling can be heard just off of the path as the smaller denizens of the
woods are scared by intrusion into their domain and seek quieter areas.  The
path continues to the west and south from here.

&+GThe &N&+cHigh Road &+GThrough Neverwinter Wood&N~
   The High Road continues it's way through the forest here in a general
north-south direction.  The road through here is hard-packed and worn.
Occasionally, the remnants of a wagon track can be seen, but it appears as
though few traders venture this far north.  Squirrels skitter through the
trees overhead in search of nuts and other food.  Every once and a while, a
cool wind blows down the road and kicks up a cloud of dust.  All in all, the
area looks pretty desolate.  The High Road continues north and south through
here.

   Just as the path turns to head deeper into the wood, it disappears
completely.  Trees and undergrowth surround the area and it appears as though
the path has simply become too overgrown to discern.  Where this path led or
who had originally used it will remain a mystery.  Squirrels hop from tree to
tree here, and chipmunks skitter about on the ground, seemingly oblivious to 
the intrusion on their home.  The path winds north from here.

shelter for the small creatures that call the river their home.  High above
the trees to the west can be seen the faint top of the walls of Neverwinter,
indicating that the city itself is not far off despite the remote feel of
this area.  The occasional snake slithers along the riverbank in search of
its next meal, but other than that, this section of the path seems largely
devoid of life.  South of here, a strange glowing can be seen coming from the
trees while the path continues to the east.

fair amount of use.  Some small shrubs sprout along the banks, but they can
provide shelter only for the few small animals that make this area of the
woods their home.  From here, the pathway slopes slowly downwards to the
south where it appears to be almost level with the great river itself and
enters something of a small bog.

   Here in the trees, two small paths come together.  One heads south along
the banks of the Neverwinter River and disappears into the woods.  The other
path heads north into the woods towards what looks to be a small clearing in
the trees.  The path heading south appears to get a fair deal of use and is
pretty well-worn.  The one heading north is much fainter and is mostly
overgrown.  Here and there, small animals dart furtively around in the trees,
but this area is mostly devoid of life.

   A small path has been worn through the woods here, allowing travel deeper
into the Neverwinter Wood.  This portion of the path is extremely narrow and
seems to serve as a connection between the High Road to the east and a larger
path to the west.  Strange noises come from the woods alongside the path and
gives this area a definite sense of unease.  All around here, the tall trees
of the Neverwinter Wood loom darkly overhead, shrouding this path in almost
perpetual shadow.

the Harpers who patrol the area, the path to the west looks treacherous at
best.  All around here, the trees of the Neverwinter Wood take on an ever-
darkening appearance as the distance from the city of Neverwinter grows.  The

trees here, although still part of the Neverwinter Wood, look much less

archway which leads into a beautiful grove.  Thorny, flowered vines twist
over the arch in an odd mixture of danger and beauty.  The peaceful sounds of
singing birds can be heard coming from within the grove.  To the north, a
pathway winds its way eastward along the banks of the Neverwinter River.

   The path winds its way through a low, marshy section of the riverbank.
The mud here is several inches deep and makes walking difficult.  Other
tracks appear in the mud, some of which are clearly humanoid and some which
cannot really be identified at all.  Clumps of cattails and other marshy
plants blossom all around this area and a faint, rotting smell seems to come
from the ground itself.  Closer to the waters edge, the mud looks very
treacherous and it is quite likely that anything venturing out too far into
the small bog may never make it back.  The path continues north, where it
appears to dry out a bit, and to the east.

path simply meanders around the trees of the Neverwinter Wood, roughly
parallel to the river.  Just west of here are the waters of the river itself
which occasionally glisten in the sun.  The path itself is shrouded in
shadows most of the time, despite being near the edge of the woods.  The
occasional fallen log or large rock periodically obscures the path, but for
the most part it remains unbroken.  The path continues north and south from

   Heading north towards the Spine of the World, the High Road meanders
through a slight bend here.  The ground is packed hard and very worn here,
showing evidence of wagon travel in the past.  In days gone by, dwarven
craftsmen from the northern stronghold of Mithril Hall would use this road to
bring their goods to market in cities like Waterdeep.  Travel has slowed in
recent years, though, and the High Road has not seen nearly the amount of
wagon traffic it once did.  The Neverwinter Wood is still held at bay at the
edges of the road here, but clearly shows signs of slowly advancing to
reclaim the land.  The High Road continues north and east from here.

road is very close to the city of Neverwinter and feels fairly secure.
However, tales of attacks this close to the city still circulate and only a
fool-hearty adventurer lets their guard down in the shadows of the

clearing in the forest near the city walls which can be seen looming over the
trees just south of here.  This clearing does not appear to have been man-
made and seems almost unnatural in the usually dense Neverwinter Wood.  It
almost appears as though the trees themselves have been crafted into the
shape of a clearing rather than having been cut away.  The Neverwinter River
flows calmly by this small clearing to the west, where a small footbridge has
been constructed to allow crossing.

heavy, moist air down into the cavern depths and then back towards the cave
opening, almost as if breathing.  The dripping of water is the only sound

&+gAn Underground Cavern&N~
   Here, the slimy water covers the floor under a pool of filth several feet
deep.  It is impossible to see more than an inch or two beneath the surface,
but ripples and swirling in the water indicate the presence of other cavern
dwellers.  Here and there, the white, bloated, and rotting bodies of dead
cavern fish float on the surface of the muck.  The sound of dripping water
monotonously echoes throughout this small cavern as water perpetually drips
from the ceiling into the murky pool.

&+gAn Underground Cavern&N~
   The murky pool of filth continues through this area.  Slime hangs thick on
the cavern walls, but is occasionally marred by the deep claw marks of some
unknown creature.  Here and there, stalactites and stalagmites have grown
together to form narrow pillars connecting the floor to the ceiling.  From
the looks of the rock formations, this cavern has been here a great deal of
time.  The cavern continues through the murky water to the south and west.

&+gAn Underground Cavern&N~
   In this corner of the cavern, the muck appears to be somewhat deeper than
elsewhere.  A slight current in the water also attests to an outlet of some
kind beneath the surface.  On the slimy walls, tiny white lizards can be seen
scampering about in an attempt to avoid the light.  The dank air of the cave
hangs thick through here, and combined with the occasional rotting bodies of
fish, makes breathing quite nauseating.  The murky cavern heads both north
and east from here.

&+gAn Underground Cavern&N~
   The murky water is somewhat shallower through here and the cave floor
actually emerges from the muck in the corner to form a slimy shelf.  On the
narrow patch of floor in the corner, a strange nest of sorts appears to have
been made.  The gruesome nest consists almost entirely of the whitened
skeletons of cavern-dwelling animals, held together with the thick, black
slime which grows throughout the cave. Here and there, though, a humanoid
skull can also be seen, giving a mute testament to the fate of past visitors.
The cave continues north and west.

&+MThe Echo Chamber&N~
   This room floats in an ethereal void and contains only one, lowly
inhabitant.  The denizen of this room is known across time and space as the
great Arch-Fiend - Binky the Rabid Chipmunk, echo mob for the Neverwinter Wood
near the city of Neverwinter.

&+LA Chamber Under the Shrine&N~
   It appears as though no one has been in this hidden chamber in centuries.
Whatever its original purpose was may never again be known.  The walls of
the chamber are of the same gray stone as the rest of the shrine, but are
covered by an almost luminous sheet of bluish ice.  Any light in the room is
reflected and refracted by the ice and gives the room an almost dazzling
look.  On the floor of the chamber is a small, raised dias on which lie
broken shards of some sort of whitish-blue pottery.  The only apparent exit
is back up the staircase to the shrine.

shards shard pottery whitish blue~
Upon closer inspection, it is possible to tell that the shards of pottery are
not actually pottery at all, but instead appear to be the remains of a very
large egg or group of eggs.

&+yUp In An Oak Tree&N~
   From this higher vantage point, the vast expanse of the Neverwinter Wood
stretches out as far as the eye can see.  The lush, dark green of the forest
canopy is broken only sporadically by clearings and continues almost unbroken
to the eastern and northern horizons.  To the southwest, the towers of the
city of Neverwinter can barely be made out.  A large branch in the tree
continues out to the west from here.  The bad smell in the air seems to be
coming from the west.

&+yA Large Branch in the Oak Tree&N~
   This large branch extends out a ways from the main trunk of the tree and
bears a great deal of foliage.  The terrible smell in the air appears to be
coming from here.  From this vantage point, the sparkling streak of the
Neverwiner River can be seen winding through the woods to the southwest.  Out
towards the end of the branch, some large bird appears to have made its nest.
The main trunk of the tree lies to the east.
