demon arkos fiend~
the Arch-Fiend Arkos~
The vile Arch-Fiend Arkos stands here grinning.~
Covered from head to toe in dark, shimmering armor, this vile demon
stands before you in his unholy glory.  Eyes of blackest night, glowing red 
with the rage of thousands of years of captivity gleam malevolently.  
Massive, bloodied horns protrude from nearly every available surface of the 
demon's body, dripping a constant stream of gore onto the ground beneath him.
He bares his pointed teeth in a smile of pure cruelty only moments before he
screams and unleashes his fury upon you.

demon demonic cyntan brighthelm chasme~
&+Ra demonic&N Cyntan Brighthelm~
A demonic version of Cyntan Brighthelm stands here.~
Dressed in fine armor with a flowing cape, Cyntan is easily one of the
most dashing individuals to make up the Neverwinter Nine.  With long, golden
hair braided neatly down his back and deep emerald eyes set in his lean,
sun-tanned face, Cyntan has been the heart's desire of many of Neverwinter's
female citizens for quite some time.  His stoic demeanor and level-headedness
make him one of the more reasonable and most respected members of Lord 
Nashar's personal leadership team.

demon demonic aermor dragonsbreath dretch~
&+Ra demonic&N &+mAermor &+WD&+Mr&+Wa&+Mg&+Wo&+Mn&+Ws&+Mb&+Wr&+Me&+Wa&+Mt&+Wh&N~
A demonic version of &+wLovely &+mAermor &+WD&+Mr&+Wa&+Mg&+Wo&+Mn&+Ws&+Mb&+Wr&+Me&+Wa&+Mt&+Wh&N stands here.~
One of the elite Neverwinter Nine, Aermor Dragonsbreath serves Lord Nashar
Alagondar in the leadership and protection of the City of Neverwinter.  Her
light, auburn hair falls loosely about her shoulders, indicative of the
care-free and relaxed attitude she typically takes.  Her lovely, lavender
eyes glance about freely, unafraid of making eye contact with strangers.
At times, a thin, wry smile crosses her lips.

demon demonic evema nightfire nabassu~
&+Ra demonic&N &+LEvema Night&N&+rfire&N~
A demonic version of &+wMysterious &+LEvema Night&N&+rfire&N stands here.~
Known for some time as one of the greatest thieves in Neverwinter, the
selection of Evema Nightfire as one of Lord Nashar's Neverwinter Nine
came as a shock to many within the city.  Although the various members of 
the Neverwinter Nine all have varied pasts, the controversial and 
mysterious Evema has always served as a topic of city gossip.  Her short,
raven-black hair and twinkling blue eyes, mask a wit as quick and sharp
as her dagger.

demon demonic laurenthyl tilvish hezrou~
&+Ra demonic&N &+GLaurenthyl Tilvish&N~
A demonic version of &+GLaurenthyl Tilvish&N stands here.~
The only member of the Neverwinter Nine of half-elven descent, Laurenthyl
Tilvish appears to have aquired the best qualities of both races.  She is
quite tall, with slighly oval, green eyes.  Her ears end in a slight point
and the overall features of her face are very strongly defined.  She tends
to carry her thin, supple frame in a very graceful and manner.  Her jet-
black hair is cut very short and curves slightly inwards just below her ear
lobes.  Despite her graceful and peaceful appearance, Laurenthyl has proven
herself time and again as a fierce fighter and defender of Lord Nashar and
the City of Neverwinter.

demon demonic vagan silverfist vrock~
&+Ra demonic&N Vagan Silverfist~
A demonic version of Vagan Silverfist stands here.~
With his signature silver guantlets set with amethysts and a thick cloak of
deep purple, Vagan Silverfist gives off an aire of cool indifference.  His
light skintone and dark, medium-length hair only add to his austere and 
aloof aura.  Deep, bluish eyes are set on both sides of his hawk-like nose,
just above a neatly trimmed goatee.

demon demonic aldan nightfire nalfeshnee~
&+Ra demonic&N &+wAldan &+LNight&N&+rfire&N~
A demonic version of &+WHeroic &N&+wAldan &+LNight&N&+rfire&N stands here.~
Brother to Evema Nightfire, Aldan is in almost every way the opposite of
his somewhat nefarious sister.  His dusty-blond hair falls loosely about his
all-too-average face.  Brownish eyes gaze at the people and objects around 
him as though constantly assessing his surroundings.  While quite capable as
a fighter, Aldan has the reputation as something of a pacifist, preferring to
use his intelligence and level head to end a situation before fisticuffs and
arms become necessary.

demon demonic lhoge firesbane marilith~
&+Ra demonic&N &+rLhoge Firesbane&N~
A demonic version of &+rLhoge Firesbane&N stands here.~
Lhoge Firesbane, the only dwarven member of the Neverwinter Nine, squints
suspiciously about the area.  Although too proud to admit that his vision
is likely suffering in his advanced age, Lhoge remains a proud and courageous
fighter.  As an emissary from Mithril Hall far to the north, Lhoge has served
as companion and protector to Lord Nashar, as well as general diplomat between
the City of Neverwinter and their secretive dwarven allies to the north.  His
long, flowing beard is slowly showing the gray streaks of his age, but remains
neatly kept.  His bulbous nose, broken in battle more times than anyone can
remember, still manages to retain its noble form.

demon demonic imdar al'vahari incubus~
&+Ra demonic&N &+yImdar Al'Vahari&N~
A demonic version of &+yImdar Al'Vahari&N stands here.~
Hailing from the deserts of Calimport, far to the south of the city, Imdar
is quite possibly the most exotic member of the Neverwinter Nine.  Dressed
in the flowing and loose robes favored by his people, it is amazing that
Imdar has chosen to live in a city located so far in the North.  Despite
the time he has spent in the chilly area around Neverwinter, Imdar's skin
retains the dark, golden-tanned hue of his homeland.  His dark-brown hair
is neatly trimmed to a short length, matching the neatly trimmed goatee
about his mouth and chin.  Somber, blue eyes peer forth from his weathered
face, speaking of horrors witnessed and wisdom gained.

demon demonic silme ogrekill succubus~
&+Ra demonic&N &+LSilme &N&+gOgrekill&N~
A demonic version of &+LSilme &N&+gOgrekill&N stands here.~
Scarred from a lifetime of conflict, Silme still manages to carry his bulky
frame with a degree of confidence and prowess.  Although his dark hair has
started to show the gray flecks of age, his strength and experience still 
mark him as a fierce warrior.  Silme earned his name defending the City of
Neverwinter against the menacing orc hordes that used to plague the norhtern
reaches.  During one raid, he single-handedly killed three ogres who had
managed to make it into the city and were in process of attacking Lord
Nashar and his bodyguards.  His deep, brown eyes seem to continually reflect
on the battles of his past, refusing to accept the slow onslaught of age.
