&+LOutside the Northeastern Gates of &N&+cNeverwinter&N~
   As the High Road winds its way through the Neverwinter Wood, the 
thoroughfare connects with the massive steel and wooden gates of the walled
&+WCity of Neverwinter&N to the south.  The ancient, but massive gates mark 
the only break in the thick stone walls of the city as they snake their way
off into the distance.  Large standards bearing the Great Seal of the City 
of Neverwinter flap lazily in the breeze above the gates as brightly armored 
city guards patrol silently atop the walls.  The clatter of activity from
the markets within the city can be heard faintly in the distance. While the
markets of the city are renowned throughout the northern Realms for the 
diversity and quality of their wares, the rather foreboding appearance of 
the city's cold, gray walls belies the supposed splendor within.  The High
Road continues to the north and east of here.

&+GOn the &N&+cHigh Road&+G Around &+WNeverwinter&N~
   The cobbled surface of the High Road meanders lazily along the northern
edge of the &+WCity of Neverwinter&N.  Even though the massive stone walls
of the city rise into the northern sky off the southern edge of the 
roadside, the looming presence of the dark and dangerous Neverwinter Wood
to the north serves as a reminder that this area is far from tamed. Although
the denizens of the city have managed to claim a small piece of civilization
from the forest, the menacing and dark forces within the Wood serve as a
constant reminder that nothing can be taken for granted in the cold
expanse of the North.  The High Road continues both west and east of here.

&+GOn the &N&+cHigh Road&+G Around &+WNeverwinter&N~
   The High Road emerges from its journey through the dark and foreboding
Neverwinter Wood near the edge of the &+WCity of Neverwinter&N.  Here, the
sight of the walls of the city often provide weary travelers with a sense
of relief and calm.  For some, they know that their destination is at hand
and that they may soon be resting comfortably in one of Neverwinter's Inns.
For others, their journey has only begun, but the nearness of the city
reminds them that even in the cold and harsh climate of the north, someone
has managed to carve out a place of safety and refuge.  A cool and crisp
breeze blows quietly through here as the High Road continues to the west 
and east.

&+GThe &N&+cHigh Road &+GThrough Neverwinter Wood&N~
   Thin, gray slits of light manage to penetrate the thick canopy of
trees overhead to dimly light the surface of the High Road as it passes
through the Neverwinter Wood.  A damp, musty odor permeates the air, 
smelling like a combination of mosses and slowly rotting wood.  Although
the High Road is well maintained while it passes this close to the 
northern &+WCity of Neverwinter&N, its usually wide girth can barely 
manage a thin, snake-like tunnel through the trees.  As the road narrows,
the deep ruts left by passing trade caravans merge to a single lane so 
as to avoid the encroaching timbers of the Wood. The High Road continues
to the west and east.

&+GThe &N&+cHigh Road &+GThrough Neverwinter Wood&N~
   Entering a minor clearing within the Neverwinter Wood, the path of
the High Road bends gracefully from the west to the south.  A slow,
steady breeze keeps the trees surrounding the road in nearly constant
motion, filling the air with a quiet and almost hypnotic rustling. At 
times, the rustling sound resembles a slow, steady breathing as if the
Neverwinter Wood itself were drawing its life breath from the cold, 
northern air.  Here and there, small piles of ash on the moss-covered
earth hint at the previous camps of travelers long forgotten.

&+yA Small Room in the Old Mercenaries' Guild&N~
&+L   This small room appears to serve as a makeshift servants' quarters
&+Lfor the keep.  Here and there along the walls, small cots have been
&+Lset up for sleeping, and a small fire burns in an unadorned fireplace
&+Lin the northern wall.  Small personal affects can be seen, gathered
&+Lnear the sleeping cots.  The faint odor of smoke permeates the
&+Lroom from the fireplace, and it appears as though the chimney may be
&+Lat least partially blocked.  A plain, wooden door leads south to 
&+Lother rooms in the small keep.&N

&+L   Judging by the desk in the middle of the chamber and the

&+Lthis room serves as the office for the Lord or Master of this keep.
&+LAlthough everything in the room is well-made and well-kept, nothing
&+Labout its design would seem to exude opulence or grandeur.  Even the
&+Lportrait on the western wall, while decorative, does not appear to
&+Lbe very well-painted.  Thin, tight beams of a dull-gray light manage 
&+Lto make their way into the room via a small windown in the northern
&+Lwall, providing at least minimal illumination for the room.  A 
&+Ldoorway leads south from here.&N

&+WThe &N&+bNeverwinter River&+W Through &N&+cNeverwinter&N~
&+b   The stoney canal walls surrounding the Neverwinter River are covered with
&+ba thin, slimy layer of green algae.  As it passes through the city, the warm
&+bwaters of the river slow to a snails pace as the flow and level of the water
&+bare carefully maintained by the city's engineers.  Before stone improvements
&+bwere made to the shore of the river where it passes through town, occasional
&+bflooding of some of the city's lower-laying areas was common.  Every spring,
&+bthe melting of the thick snows of the northern winters would swell the river
&+bto enormous proportions.  Now, with the high stone embankments protecting the
&+bcity, the only real threat from the river is the potential health risk posed
&+bby the increasingly tepid waters.  A strong, somewhat bitter odor hangs in
&+bthe air here, rising from the surface of the water.  North of here, a thick
&+riron gate&+b is anchored into the stone walls of the city, preventing watercraft
&+bor larger denizens of the river from entering or exiting the city.  Magical
&+bwards placed by mages of Neverwinter help ensure that no one tampers with the
&+bgates without sending silent alerts to the city guards and militia.  The 
&+bNeverwinter River continues south from here where it passes under the famed
&+bDolphin Bridge of the city.&N

&+WA Storeroom in the &+BT&N&+ye&+Bm&N&+yp&+Bl&N&+ye &+Bo&N&+yf &+BO&N&+yg&+Bh&N&+ym&+Ba&N~
&+L   Despite the relatively luxurious appointments of the rest of the Temple of
&+LOghma, this room has been kept very simple, largely due to its rather mundane
&+Lpurpose.  A few, rather bland and somewhat tattered standards of Oghma hang
&+Lon the rough stone walls, but other than that, the only real features of the
&+Lroom are the stacks of crates and various supplies for the day-to-day
&+Loperation of the temple.  Several of the wooden boxes in the store room have
&+Lbeen marked with symbols of warning and danger.  A simple, cursory inspection
&+Lof the crates, combined with the strong odor eminating from the crates would
&+Lseem to indicate that they contain kerosene or a similarly flammable liquid
&+Lfor use in the large torches and braziers of the temple.  A small fire in this
&+Lroom could quickly get out of hand and cause a great deal of damage to the
&+Lrest of the temple.  A small doorway leads east out of the storeroom.&N

&+B   Brilliant, white marble walls surround this spacious chamber.  Rooms of this 
&+Bsize would normally reverberate loudly with echoed sounds from throughout the
&+Btemple.  However, as with the rest of the House of Knowledge, all sounds seem
&+Bsomewhat muted in here and even the loudest shouts echo only as soft whispers.
&+BThe walls of this room are rather sparsely decorated, featuring only a few 
&+Bbeautifully crafted standards bearing the various symbols for Oghma.  High 
&+Boverhead, crystalline skylights allow the natural lighting of the skies over 
&+BNeverwinter to fill the chamber.  A small doorway leads west from here to 
&+Banother chamber of the temple while a vaulted marble archway to the east leads

&+Bbeen etched with delicate, detailed scenes of the vast Neverwinter Wood and
&+Bsome of the outskirts of the city of Neverwinter.  A thin, runner carpet leads
&+Bdown the very center of the hallway's floor, royal blue in color and a richly
&+Bwoven with traces of gold thread.  At the very eastern end of the hallway, a
&+Bspiral staircase leads upwards to more chambers in the temple.  The western

&+wdominates a majority of the room's center.  High overhead, under vaulted
&+wceilings supported with thick, dark timbers hang the standards of the
&+wcity of Neverwinter and the various lords who have ruled it through the
&+wyears.  A few, lesser-known pennants hang along the walls at odd intervals,
&+wperhaps dedicated to soldiers stationed at this garrison who performed
&+wheroic deeds in days past.  Although the room appears as though it could
&+whold nearly all the soldiers of the keep at once, only a few lonely souls
&+wseem to be taking respite in it at the present.  The only visible exit is
&+wthrough the arched stone doorway to the west.&N

&+rThe Entrance to the Keep&N~
&+w   Thick stone walls, decorated with various sorts of arms and armor surround
&+wthis small entrace to the northeastern keep of the city of Neverwinter.  Each
&+wof the city's massive gates is protected by a minor keep of some sort and this
&+wgate, one of the more heavily trafficked of the city, is no exception.  Several
&+whundred soldiers may be stationed here at any one time, providing ample 
&+wprotection from any threat to the city.  In the past, the most serious threats 
&+wcame from the dangerous creatures of the Neverwinter Wood or from wandering orc
&+whordes.  However, in more recent times, the hostile city of Luskan to the north 
&+whas stepped up its attempts to control the powerful city of Neverwinter, and 
&+whas launched several devestating attacks on the city in an attempt to 
&+wdestabilize the current government.  A wide stone archway leads east from here 
&+wtowards the rest of the keep's interior while massive wooden doors lead south

&+rA Room in the Keep&N~
&+w   This sprawling chamber opens up beneath vaulted ceilings spanning
&+wnumerous floors of the large northeastern keep of the city.  Massive wooden
&+wchandeliers and numerous torches are used throughout the large room in an
&+wattempt to provide at least minimal light to the floor of the cavernous room.
&+wEchoed shouts and conversations from throughout the keep echo through the
&+wexpanse of the chamber, creating a constant din of background noise.  Every
&+wnow and then, heavily armed soldiers and members of the city guard pass 
&+wthrough the room while making their rounds or simply on their way to other
&+wdestinations within the building.  The air in the chamber is relatively
&+wmoist and cool as the thick stone walls and lack of any visible natural 
&+wwindows keep the room's climate almost cave-like.  A wide stone staircase
&+wleads upwards from the floor of the chamber towards the upper stories of
&+wthe massive keep while an arched stone doorway leads down a passage to the
&+weast towards other areas of the keep.  To the east of here lies a much

&+wsconces in an attempt to keep the passageway lit, but the gradual bend of
&+wthe tunnel from west to south greatly limits the intended effectiveness of 
&+wthe torches.  Thick deposits of tarry soot cling to the gray walls above
&+wthe torches from the many years of constant burning, indicating the age of
&+wthe keep that has stood here nearly as long as the city itself.  The air of
&+wthe passageway is relatively warm and has a thick, acrid odor to it from the
&+wconstant burning of the torches on the walls.  As the long passageway winds

   Tall and majestic oak trees rise high into the sky over the High

cold northern air, their appearance would seem calming if not for the
uneasy presence provided by the shadowy and fearsome Neverwinter Wood.
Even the normal sounds of the forest seem somehow different and
foreboding as they trickle slowly and cautiously from deeper within
the depths of the forest.  The barren and increasingly rocky surface
of the High Road continues both north and south from here.

&+Lany of the once opulent or valuable furnishings, leaving only ghosts of

&+LSmall pieces of furniture and an old table sit forgotten and unused.  Still

&+Ltoo has long since faded from its previous glory.  A dry, musty odor hangs

sailors and merchants stroll slowly about as they go about their business.
High overhead, above the rooftops of the city, seagulls slowly drift about
on thermals as they watch the ground for scraps of food.  Now and then some
of the gulls will dip down for a closer look at objects of interest, but 
they generally remain relatively motionless in their incessant flight.  The

&+L   Carving its wide path between the dwellings and businesses of Neverwinter, 
&+LColdsteel Street continues east and west through here.  The buildings 
&+Lsurrounding the street appear well-kept and well-maintained. Many of their 
&+Lplaster facades have been painted a bright whitish-gray, complimenting the 
&+Ldarker, almost black color of their wooden timbers. Although most of the 
&+Lbuildings in the city are constructed of stone, some of the citizens choose to 
&+Lhave the exteriors plastered and painted in order to differentiate their 
&+Lappearance.  The occasional flower box can be seen dotting some of the windows 
&+Lof the buildings, adding another splash of color to the area and filling the 
&+Lcool breeze with a light fragrance.&N

&+CColdsteel Street&N~
&+L   A cool breeze blows down the street here, smelling faintly of the salt
&+Lair blown in from the Trackless Sea.  In years gone by, this area was 
&+Ldotted with massive foundaries that choked the air with soot and smoke.  As
&+Ltrade with the dwarves of Mithril Hall increased, the need for local 
&+Lproduction of steel diminished and the foundaries closed.  The buildings that
&+Lonce housed the foundaries have since been converted into warehouses and other
&+Lbusinesses, but the street still retains the name it garnered in ages past.
&+LThe paved surface of the street consists of the same hard, gray stone that is
&+Lfound throughout the city.  To the south, a small alleyway cuts between two
&+Lof the buildings lining the street.&N

&+Lsurrounding buildings and fills the air with a cacophony of sound.  Statues
&+Lof leaping dolphins and waterspouts adorn the railings of the bridge.  Each

&+yEntrance to the Old Mercenaries' Guild&N~
&+L   This small, cozy chamber once served as the main entryway to the Old

&+Lfunction in Neverwinter society, the mercenaries of the city could be hired for
&+Lany number of noble and nefarious purposes whenever a group of adventurers 
&+Lrequired assistance.  The once polished wooden paneling of the chamber has since
&+Ldulled and decayed from the years of neglect.  Thick wooden doorways that once 
&+Lbarred entrance to the Guild to all but the select members, now stand largely 
&+Lajar on their hinges, the strong, burly guards long gone.  The stale, musty 
&+Lscent of dry rot has infested the air of the building, further hinting at the 
&+Lrapid decay of the structure since the Guild was disbanded and the building

&+LA Small Room in a Dingy Dwelling&N~
&+w   Thin, dusty streams of light slice through the air of this room at odd
&+wintervals, eminating from the poorly-kept roof overhead.  While a vast majority
&+wof the buildings in Neverwinter are pristinely maintained, this one has clearly
&+wbeen neglected, likely due to its location off of a small alley.  It is hard to
&+wbelieve that anyone could call this filthy hovel a home, but the presence of a
&+wfew relatively dry sleeping mats and a still-smoking cooking fire hint at the
&+wrecent passing of at least a few inhabitants.  A narrow, open doorway leads
&+wsouth from this room to a larger room in the dwelling, and ultimately back out

through here manage to keep their thick, luscious greenery in full bloom 
year round.  Due to meticulously groomed and pampered plants, combined with a
bit deal of good-natured magic, even in the harshest winters, flowers can be 
found here blooming as if it were the middle of summer.  A light, cool breeze 
blows down the street, carrying the fragrances of the various flowering plants.
Tall, stone-framed buildings stand on the eastern and western sides of the 
street, sporting a variety of planters and trellises.  Garden Street continues
through the City of Neverwinter both north and south through here.

&+bbath.  Large dragonflies dart about slowly in the mist, tossed about lazily

&+bbunches of reeds and grasses have formed where the water is shallow enough
&+bto allow their roots to gain a foothold in the muddy bottom of the river.
&+bThe quiet croaking of frogs can be heard coming from the reeds, disturbed

&+b   Passing under the massive stone walls of the city of Neverwinter, the 
&+bwarm waters of the Neverwinter River continue their slow trek towards the
&+bTrackless Sea, despite the presence of this now bustling city.  The 
&+bthunderous roar of a waterfall nearby reverberates through the air, despite
&+bthe deadening thickness of the city walls.  Finely mortared walls of stone
&+bnow line the normally muddy banks of the river, preventing erosion from
&+bundermining the foundations of any of the tall buildings which surround the
&+bsides of the river like giant stone sentinels.  The waters of the river
&+bappear to be filtered by a massive iron grate set in the stone walls, most
&+blikely to prevent any of the creatures of the surrounding Neverwinter Wood
&+bfrom using the warm waters as an avenue into the city.  Most of the natural
&+bdenizens of the water, however, appear largely unaffected by the presence of
&+bthe grate as larger fish can still be seen jumping skywards in search of
&+bthe occasional insect.  The Neverwinter River continues to the west from here,

&+b   Apparently popular with the locals of the warehouse district, this tavern

&+blines the back wall of the small room, amply stocked with numerous kegs of
&+bale.  In addition to the seating at the bar, several tables lie scattered 
&+babout the small room, providing some additional seating for the rather 
&+bburly-looking patrons of the bar.  Even with the additional space provided 
&+bby the tables, several patrons of the bar are forced to stand in small 
&+bgroups, quietly conversing with one another.  Every now and then, arguments
&+bappear to get somewhat heated, but a stern look from the gargantuan
&+bbartender of the bar seems to quickly quiet any chance of fisticuffs.  To the

be heard floating through the air as conversations take place and business 
is conducted.  Strangely scented spices and wares from lands far away fill

&+wThe Main Room of the &+mFallen Tower&N~
&+r   While the occasional shout echoes out above the general din of the
&+rconversation in the bar, the general mood of the room seems somewhat
&+rsubdued.  As the most popular tavern in the City of Neverwinter, the 
&+rFallen Tower has a mysterious and magical past that continues to draw
&+rsightseers and local regulars alike.  The remains of the ancient tower 
&+rthat this tavern is built inside of can clearly be seen, despite the
&+rrenovations that had to be made in order to make the building serviceable
&+ragain.  Several long, more communal tables are intermingled with smaller,
&+rmore personal circular tables fill nearly every square inch of this room.
&+rThe only relatively clear space is the very center of the room where a
&+rbronze railing outlines a circular hole in the floor.  Despite the light
&+rprovided by the flickering torches on the walls and the candles spread
&+rthroughout the tables of the room, the hole at the center of the room
&+rremains oddly darkened and somewhat ominous, although none of the patrons

&+r   The subdued sounds of conversation and revelry can be heard in this
&+rroom, echoing in from the main room of the tavern to the west.  Once a
&+rmassive tower of magic in the City of Neverwinter, only the first floor of
&+rthe structure remains and has since been turned into Neverwinter's most
&+rpopular tavern.  This entryway, although somewhat refurbished to fit its
&+rnew function as the entrance to the tavern, clearly shows the signs of its
&+rprevious role as the atrium of the tower.  Here and there, the remnants of
&+rmagical glyphs can still be seen, etched into the old stone foundation of
&+rthe tower.  The floor in the center of this room still bears the crest of
&+rthe tower's last occupant, Llomnauvel 'Firehands' Oloadhin of Neverwinter.

&+GGarden Street in &+WNeverwinter&N~
   The greenery along Garden Street continues through here as the street
makes its way northward from the beautiful Gardens of Neverwinter to the
south.  On the western side of the road here, the usually plant-encrusted
buildings of the street are replaced by a solemn, dark-stoned building.
A plain, wooden sign proclaims the building to be '&+mThe Fallen Tower&N', 
Neverwinter's most popular tavern.  The massive building is little more 
than the first-floor remains of what was once a tall, mysterious tower of
sorcery within the city.  Several years ago, a massive magical duel between
the tower's owner and a group of unknown wizards cause the almost complete
destruction of the building.  Since then, it has been renovated and converted
into the best grog-house within the city, popular among citizens and travelers
alike.  East of here stands another landmark of the city, the armory known as
'&+WThe Shining Knight &+LArms&+W and &+LArmor&N'.  Garden Street continues both north and

&+WThe &N&+bNeverwinter River&+W Through &N&+cNeverwinter&N~
&+b   As the current of the river gently churns through here, small 
&+bdisturbances ripple the surface of the water.  Although a deep, clear blue
&+bin places, this particular stretch of the water is sullied and brown with
&+bthe general runoff and pollution from the surrounding city of Neverwinter.
&+bAlong the rock-paved banks, small crops of white lilies have sprouted, 
&+bbringing a fresh breath of beauty to the otherwise drab surroundings.  Even
&+bhere, amidst the crowding and development of the city, the natural beauty 
&+bof the area that was once part of the Neverwinter Wood appears resolved to
&+bmaintain its foothold.  The lazy flow of the Neverwinter River continues

&+wA Small Landing Near the &+bNeverwinter River&N~
&+w   Surrounded entirely by tall buildings, this small landing is completely
&+wisolated from the rest of the city.  One would likely question the city
&+wengineer who decided to place a landing for watercraft in this inaccessible
&+wlocation.  The surface of the landing has been paved with grayish stones to
&+wprevent erosion from the passing waters of the river.  In one corner of the
&+wlanding, a small shelter has been built in the relative shelter provided by
&+wthe high buildings of the area.  A tiny cooking fire has been lit outside
&+wthe shelter, a thin trail of smoke leading high into the skies overhead.
&+wThe only apparent egress from this location would seem to be back along the

&+gThe &+yUpland Rise&N~
&+g   Despite the similarity of this area to the surrounding Neverwinter Woods, the
&+gusually dark and oppressive feeling of the forest outside the city walls is not 
&+gpresent.  Although the skies overhead are largely blocked out by the tall trees 
&+gof the area, enough light manages to penetrate the canopy to illuminate the 
&+ggrassy ground below.  A steep, cliff-like dropoff all but rings this area, 
&+gleading sharply downwards towards the rooftops of the city below.  From the edge
&+gof the precipice, it is possible to get a wonderful view of the sprawling city
&+gof Neverwinter as it stretches out to fill the valley below to the blueish 
&+gwaters of the Sea of Swords on the western horizon.  Throughout the area, small 
&+gwoodland creatures hop about in the natural foliage of the Upland Rise, 
&+goblivious to the bustling city that lies below.  The dense, wild vegetation and 
&+gtrees of the Upland Rise continue to the east from here.&N

&+gThe &+yUpland Rise&N~
&+g   Left as a natural park within the sheltering walls of the city, the area
&+gthrough here very much represents what this spot was like before the gradual
&+gencroachment and development of the city.  Tall, dark trees rise high over 
&+gthe trails through the entire park, shading the ground below with their thick
&+gleaves.  Although the hilly area of the Upland Rise is a good deal higher than
&+gthe rest of the city of Neverwinter, the thick foliage of the trees prevents 
&+gobtaining a good view of the city below.  Underfoot, the normally stone-paved
&+gstreets of Neverwinter are replaced by the natural earthen ground of the forest.
&+gSparse patches of grass lay interspersed with small bushes and shrubs, 
&+gcluttering the narrow pathways beneath the trees.  A few, solitary birds can be
&+gheard chirping quietly from their high perches in the trees overhead.  The 
&+gwooded area of the Upland Rise continues to the east and west from here.&N

&+g   Unspoiled by the development of the rest of the city, the Upland Rise 
&+gcontinues through here on a hillock high above the city of Neverwinter.  
&+gAlthough the natural forest of the park is a relatively wild place, its 
&+glocation within the city walls helps ensure that none of the dangerous 
&+gcreatures of the nearby Neverwinter Wood can threaten citizens or travelers
&+gwho choose to visit this place.  Ringing the small path around the Upland 
&+gRise stand tall, densely-packed trees of various type and age.  The air here
&+gsmells moist and fresh, attesting to the unblemished status of the surrounding
&+gflora.  The hard, earth surface of the path does not appear to see a lot of 
&+gfoot traffic, but the occasional impression of a footprint indicates that 
&+gsome visitors must pass through here at least occasionally.  The pathway

   A fine, chill mist hangs in the air over the High Road as it weaves 
its way through the trees of the Neverwinter Wood here.  A faint breeze 
occasionally churns through the mist, giving it the appearance of taking 
on a life all its own.  Birds can be heard chirping from their vantage 
points in the limbs above the road, but the combination of the thick foliage
and swirling mist keep them hidden from even the most prying of eyes.  The

&+yA Room in the Warehouse&N~
&+L   Apparently forgotten for some time, the contents of this room seem to
&+Lhave fallen victim to dry rot and decay.  Small stacks of crates stand 
&+Lneatly stacked along the stuccoed walls of the room, intersperced with the
&+Loccasional barrel or chest.  In the center of the room, a few of the crates
&+Lhave been opened and thrown about carelessly, strewing the straw packing
&+Lmaterial across the rough wooden flooring.  Whatever had been stored in the
&+Lfew opened crates has since disappeared, most likely the victim of the few
&+Lthieves who dare brave the vengence of the city guard.  Cobwebs have started
&+Lto form amongst the wooden rafters of the room, slowly thickening with layers
&+Lof the gathering dust.  Despite the lack of upkeep to this room, the roof
&+Loverhead appears to have held out remarkably well and this warehouse would
&+Lappear to be more than serviceable should a new owner decide to take charge
&+Lof its care.  A simple wood-framed doorway leads south from here.&N

be heard coming from one of the warning bells on a buoy anchored in the 
waters of the harbor.  All throughout this area, people engaged in the 
operation and maintenance of Neverwinter's shipping industry can be seen 
scurrying about on their everyday tasks.  The Old Wharf Road continues to

&+mThick veins of steam rise slowly from the pot, filling the building with the

&+mwooden cots have been set up against the eastern wall, made simply with beige

&+mappear to look outwards towards a wide, brightly lit alley or roadway.  Despite

the surface of Garden Street to the east of here.  The upper stories of
the building have been painted with light frescos, depicting the historic
battle between the dragons Arauthator and Rathalylaug that took place over
the rooftops of the city years ago.  Many of the citizens of Neverwinter 
witnessed the fearsome battle as it raged in the skies overhead, leading to
a variety of heroic retellings of the epic encounter.  North and south from
here, the plant-covered expanse of Garden Street continues its meanderings
through the City of Neverwinter.  West of here, a smaller, less-traveled
alleyway winds off between the buildings of the city.  A large dwelling lies

&+yA Hallway in the &+GRangers' Guild&N~
&+y   This wide hallway, framed with rough timbers of dark wood, winds its
&+yway silently through the Rangers' Guild in the Upland Rise overlooking the
&+ycity of Neverwinter.  A small window framed with a thin pane of distorted
&+yglass lies in the western wall, allowing a slight view of the thick forest
&+ysurrounding the guild hall itself.  As the wind outside blows against the
&+ysimple wooden structure of the guild, the ancient timbers creak and groan
&+yslightly, as if longing for their long-forgotten leaves and branches.  A
&+ythick carpet of woven grass lines the floor of the hallway, and appears to
&+yhave seen a great deal of traffic over the years.  The hallway continues
&+yto the south of here, towards the main rooms of the guild.  The guarded
&+yentrance of the guild lies to the east.&N

&+yThe Entrance to the &+GRangers' Guild&N~
&+y   This small but cozy room serves as the entryway for the Rangers' Guild of
&+yNeverwinter.  Established in the natural park within the city walls known as
&+ythe Upland Rise, this location offers the rangers of the city natural 
&+ysurroundings, protected safely within the city walls.  The previous Guild
&+yHall for the rangers of Neverwinter was located in the nearby Neverwinter 
&+yWood, but was destroyed several decades ago by one of the evil denizens of
&+ythe forest.  Since then, the decision was made to move the headquarters of
&+ythe guild to a safer location within the protecive walls of the city.  The
&+yroom of the entryway is sparsely decorated, featuring mostly potted plants
&+yand furniture made of the natural materials of the forest.  To the west of
&+yhere, through a plain wooden door, lies the interior of the guild itself, 
&+yaccessible only to guild members.  To the east lies the natural beauty of 
&+ythe Upland Rise in the city of Neverwinter.&N

&+gThe &+yUpland Rise&N~
&+g   The thick vegetation of the Upland Rise thins somewhat through here as it
&+gnears a wood and stone structure.  Standing quietly below the tall trees of
&+gthe upland rise, the cabin-like building seems to be made of the natural
&+gelements of the Upland Rise and blends very harmoniously with its 
&+gsurroundings.  Thick, green moss has started to grow on the walls of the
&+gstructure, making it appear one with its natural surroundings.  The faint
&+gscent of burning wood can be detected coming from the chimney of the building,
&+gadding the only unnatural scent to the crisp, clean air.  The wooded Upland 
&+gRise continues to the north of here, while a plain wooden door offers 
&+gentrance to the cabin just to the west.&N

&+GThe &N&+cHigh Road &+GThrough Neverwinter Wood&N~
   Tall, shadowy trees are packed densely alongside the rocky,
dirt-covered surface of the High Road.  To the east of the road, two large, 
gray stones seem oddly out of place amongst the green and brown foliage of 
the Neverwinter Wood.  The remnants of several campfires near the base of the 
stones would seem to indicate that they have served as makeshift shelter for
road-weary travelers in the recent past.  The moist, earthy smell of the
surrounding forest drifts by on a gentle breeze.  The High Road continues

&+L   Much like the other warehouses of the warehouse district, this room is quite
&+Lsimple.  Framed in wooden timbers lined with a chalky, white stucco, the walls
&+Lof the building were clearly built for a utilitarian, rather than decorative
&+Lfunction.  Thick coats of dust line the floors of the warehouse, although clear
&+Lpaths have been worn through the dirt from passing foot traffic.  Here and 
&+Lthere, stacks of simple wooden crates and barrels have been placed in small 
&+Lgroups, corresponding to the stored wares of various shippers.  Overall, 
&+Lhowever, the room is far from holding its capacity.  Simple wood-framed 
&+Ldoorways lead north and south from this room to other storage areas of the

   A cool, salty breeze blows over the surface of the road here, slowly passing
over the city from the Sea of Swords to the west.  All along the sides of the
road here, large wood and stone buildings used as warehouses stand silent and
seemingly empty.  The Old Wharf Road is normally quite crowded with carts
bearing crates and barrels of goods as they are moved from the docks of the 
city on the Bay of Mists to the warehouses through here.  This particular 
portion of the street, however, seems somewhat less crowded than most.  The Old
Wharf Road continues to the north and south from here as it continues to wind 
generally southward through the warehouses on the western edge of the city.

&+m   Despite the relatively simple decorations of this small room, the building
&+mgives off a very warm and friendly feeling.  A faint, smokey scent in the air
&+mhints at the preparation of a meal.  From the delightful smells, it would seem 
&+mthat the cook in charge of the meal is quite proficient at his or her skills.
&+mThick, rich beams of light stream in through half-open windows near the ceiling 
&+mof the building, amply lighting the small space of the room.  A simple, wood-
&+mframed doorway leads north through the white-plastered walls towards a smaller
&+mroom within the building.  To the east of here lies the bustling, stone-paved
&+msurface of the Wyrmfrost Road as is winds its way through Neverwinter.&N

&+c   Tall, timbered buildings rise alongside the road, shading the paved surface
&+cof the road from the meager sun overhead.  Weathered wooden shutters have been
&+cclosed tightly over the small windows of the buildings, leaving them with a cold
&+cand rather inhospitable appearance.  One such pair of shutters, on the upper 
&+cstory of a building on the western side of the road, has apparently not been 
&+cfastened down properly and waves lazily in the soft breeze.  The gentle creaking
&+cof the slightly rusted hinges seems to echo softly through the air, 
&+cunadulterated by any interfering noise from the surrounding area.  Normally a 
&+cbustling thoroughfare, Wyrmfrost Road seems somewhat deserted through here as it
&+cpasses north and south through the city.  To the west, a small warehouse of 
&+csorts stands a silent vigil.&N

&+w   A faint, musty odor hangs in this otherwise clean and tidy home.  With
&+wits sparse and rather simple decorations, this dwelling probably belongs
&+wto a relatively middle-class family of the city.  Simple, wooden furniture
&+wis spread around the main room of the home, which apparently serves as both
&+wa main gathering room and a kitchen.  A simple, woven rug of rough grass
&+wcovers the uneven wooden floor of the building.  Although probably a deep
&+wred at one time, the rug has since faded to a dull and rather dry semblance
&+wof its former glory.  A rough-hewn doorway leads west from the main room out

&+Lthrough the rough, plank roof overhead.  The whinnies of the horses in the

&+Wof the counter has been hand-carved with intricate scenes of valiant holy
&+Wwarriors performing heroic deeds throughout the Realms.  The walls of the
&+Wchamber a paneled in a simple, light-colored wood.  Here and there, marble
&+Winlays have been set into the walls, but no decorations of any kind hang in
&+Wthe chamber.  A wood- and marble-framed archway leads eastward from this small

&+Wthe presence of numerous holy relics and the smells of burning incense.  A
&+Wsmall, unadorned altar resides on the northern wall of the room, covered with
&+Wburning candles that emit a soft, gentle glow.  Along with the candles, several
&+Wstained glass windows in the walls of the room help to add a soft illumination
&+Wto the interior of the room during daylight hours.  The windows depict scenes
&+Wof holy warriors engaged in numerous acts of faith and courage, from helping

&+Wlead to the main halls of the guild where only those of true faith may wander

carrying with it the scent and occasional petal of the nearby flowers.  Off
to the west of the street stands a small, but richly decorated temple.  
Serving as the local Paladins' Guild, the temple is not specific to any 
particular god, choosing instead to accept the faith of all of those dedicated
to the pursuit of goodness and truth in the Realms.  Garden Street continues

&+cof the room.  Steam continuously rises from the water of the fountain,
&+cindicating some sort of unseen heat source below the stone flooring of the
&+cchamber.  Wooden benches, encrusted with thick green moss line the interior of
&+cthe greenhouse, stacked with pots growing all manner of plant and flower.  Some
&+cof the varieties grown in this greenhouse look almost unnatural in nature,
&+cclearly coming from corners of the Realms far removed from the cool, mild

have covered the surface of the road.  The faint smell of smoke can be detected
in the breeze, although its source cannot be easily identified.  The normal 
sounds of the forest are present here, but somewhat muted at times as though 
the denizens of Neverwinter Wood have grown cautious or fearful of something.

&+GThe &N&+cHigh Road &+GThrough Neverwinter Wood&N~
   A strange, coyingly sweet odor drifts through the cool air around the 
road.  While a few small, violet flowers pepper the shady ground beneath 
the trees alongside the road, it is doubtful that they are the sole source 
of the scent in the air.  The flowers growing in the shade are a bright, 
almost iridescent purple and appear very delicate and almost gossamer-like 
as they ripple softly in the gentle breeze.Somewhere to the east, faint 
sounds reminiscent of conversation at a loud party can be heard.  The 
well-worn surface of the High Road continues through the Neverwinter Wood 
to the west and east.

   The High Road widens slightly through here as it winds its way through 
the Neverwinter Wood.  The normally encroaching trees of the forest 
actually recede enough here to allow a large amount of the grayish skies of
the north show through to the ground.  On the east side of the High Road, a 
rather solitary and barren oak tree stands, gathering a murder of crows in 
its branches.  Calling loudly to one another, any peace and tranquility this 
area may have had is easily shattered.  The High Road continues both north
and west of here.

&+yThe Entrance to the Warehouse&N~
&+L   This small room serves as the entrance to a rather large warehouse alongside
&+Lthe Old Wharf Road.  Massive, double wooden doors along the back wall of the
&+Lroom serve as the primary service entrance for the loading and unloading of the
&+Llarge crates and barrels brought in from the docks of the city.  The air in 
&+Lthis entryway carries a slight salty scent to it, indicating the nearness of 
&+Lthe city's harbor, but the air itself is quite dry.  It is possible that the 
&+Lowners of this warehouse have hired a local wizard to place protective spells 
&+Lon the building to help keep the air unnaturally dry.  To the north, though a 
&+Lwide, open doorway lies a much larger room in the warehouse where a majority 
&+Lof the cargo stored in the building is kept.  East of here lies the stoney 
&+Lsurface of the Old Wharf Road as it passes roughly north and south along the 
&+Lcity's western walls.&N

   As the Old Wharf Road passes along the western edge of the city, it falls
beneath the shadow of a massive, multi-story warehouse to the west of here.
Lanterns can be seen flickering through the darkened windows of the building,
apparently providing ample light within the structure.  The only visible 
entrance to the building from here is through a pair of narrow, double wooden
doors.  Considering that the doors are barely wide enough to allow the passage
of two people at once, the goods stored within the building must probably be
brought inside from an entrance located elsewhere.  Old Wharf Road continues to

&+LA Packed Room in the Small Warehouse&N~
&+y   Despite the rather small size of this chamber, it is filled to capacity with
&+yseemingly hundreds of wooden crates and boxes.  The stacks of stored goods are 
&+ypiled from the rough wooden floors to the very rafters of the ceiling.  The 
&+yonly real way to navigate around the room is by treading along the narrow 
&+ypassageways created by the stacks.  The tops of the crates along the walkway
&+yare quite dry and dusty and more than a few are almost buried under thick 
&+ycobwebs.  The wooden floor between the crates, however, is relatively free 
&+yfrom dust and it appears as though someone must pass through here on a fairly

&+c   As the Wyrmfrost Road bends slightly through here, it passes near a massive
&+cstone tower.  Rising high over the surrounding buildings, the dark stone 
&+cstructure gives off a strange, foreboding feeling.  The very top of the tower, 
&+cor at least the portion of it that can be seen through the low cloud cover,  is
&+cdecorated with carved stone statues depicting numerous mystical creatures.  Only
&+ca few, small windows dot the outside of the tower, likely keeping the inside as 
&+cshaded and gloomy as the outside.  Every now and then, a slight flicker of 
&+cmulticolored light reflects from inside the tower through the small windows, 
&+chinting as signs of life within.  Perhaps in response to the presence of the
&+ctower itself, this area of the Wyrmfrost Road is unusually quiet and deserted.  
&+cEven the few travelers and locals who happen by appear to hurry through this

&+chigh above the street to the south.  A pair of gaping, wrought iron gates
&+cleading to a sparsely decorated courtyard stand closed off to the sporadic
&+cpassing traffic on the street.  Surrounding the courtyard and the tower stands
&+ca high, stone wall constructed of a dull, blackish rock.  Twisted metal blades,
&+crusted from ages of exposure to the harsh elements of the north line the top of

&+cthe tower.  Ringing the tower at regular intervals, likely representing the

&+bSea.  Although the river is relatively low at present, in past years, flooding
&+bhad raised the water high enough to threaten several of the surrounding homes
&+band businesses.  In response to such threats, the city engineers of Neverwinter
&+bbuilt massive stone walls all along the river where it passes through the city.
&+bThe light winters in the mountains far to the north of the city are likely to 
&+bblame for the currently low levels, although no one knows for sure exactle where

&+GThe &N&+cHigh Road &+GThrough Neverwinter Wood&N~
   A mixture of deciduous and coniferous trees line the sides of the
road here.  The ground below the trees is thick with underbrush and
the fallen branches of the trees themselves.  A thick, earthy smell
hangs in the air.  The density of the brush below the trees makes it
difficult to see too far into the forest, but the quiet sounds of
scurrying creatures still make their way to the road, indicating the
existance of life.  The High Road continues north and south from here.

&+wthe numerous paper stacks.  Amid the clutter of the office sits a small,
&+wuninteresting desk made of rough-hewn oak.  Despite the location of this

&+LThe &N&+yOld Wharf &+LRoad&N~
   Buildings large and small surround the sides of the street through here,
performing a number of functions for the people responsible for moving the
vast variety of goods through the city of Neverwinter.  As a major city 
located on both the High Road and Sea of Swords in the northern Realms,
Neverwinter provides an extremely suitable location for the shipping of many
of the goods from both Mithril Hall to the north and Waterdeep to the south.
As a result of its prized location and prominance in trading activities, the
city of Neverwinter has grown quite wealthy on tariffs and the general boost
its economy enjoys from the merchants and travelers passing through its gates.
Even here, in the poorer section of town, the buildings are still relatively
well-kept when compared to those of other cities.  A small, wood and stone
warehouse lies on the eastern side of the road, while a smaller, less obvious
building stands to the west.

&+LA Small Room in a Warehouse&N~
&+y   This room of the warehouse is surprisingly small and tightly packed
&+ywith all manner of packaged goods.  While likely intended to serve as an 
&+yentryway or small office for the warehouse, this room has been converted to 
&+ya regular storage room to accomodate the large amount of cargo that has been 
&+ystored here.  Unlike the majority of the other warehouses in the western 
&+yportions of this city, this one is filled seemingly beyond capacity as crates
&+yand barrels are stacked from the floor to pitched ceiling overhead.  In some
&+yinstances, the tops of the stacked crates tower just above the tops of some
&+yof the support timbers spanning the chamber.  A small, cleared area has been
&+ycreated in the center of the room to allow workers and cargo inspectors to
&+ymaneuver around a little as they perform their duties, but the space would
&+yhardly be considered ample.  A wooden doorway in the western wall leads out
&+yto the Old Wharf Road while another, seemingly equally-packed room lies just

&+bThe End of a Hallway in the &+LMages' Guild&N~
&+L   The cold, stone hallway of the first floor of the Mages' Guild of 
&+LNeverwinter ends rather abruptly as it turns a corner here.  A single, 
&+Lancient-looking torch burns on one of the three otherwise bare walls at the 
&+Lend of the hall, casting an eerie greenish glow into the hall.  Other than 
&+Lthe obvious choice of turning around and heading back down the curving 
&+Lhallway of the tower, the only possible egress from the end of the hallway
&+Lwould seem to be via a single, dangling rope which appears to be suspended
&+Lin mid air.  The bottom of the rope hangs just inches from the floor, but
&+Lthe top disappears mysteriously into a seeming void of nothingness where the
&+Lstone ceiling of the hall should be.  It is impossible to tell from this
&+Lvantage point whether the ceiling to this chamber is truly missing, or wheter
&+Lit is simply higher than the feeble green light of the hall's torch can reach.&N

&+L   A dismal calm hangs over this small courtyard which serves as the entrance
&+Lto the Mages' Guild of Neverwinter.  While a great deal of vegetation has 
&+Lbeen planted around the courtyard, the usually vibrant green of the plant life
&+Lseems somewhat gray and muted in the presence of the magical tower overhead.
&+LEven the air in the courtyard seems stale and lifeless, clinging limply to the
&+Ldepressed surroundings.  To the east of here, tall wooden doors lead into the
&+Ltower proper, accessible only by those members of the guild who practice the
&+Lvarious arcane arts in their pursuit of knowledge and power.  North of this

&+bThe Entryway of the &+LMages' Guild&N~
&+L   This cold, empty room serves as the rather bleak and uninviting entrance
&+Lto the Mages' Guild of Neverwinter.  Once a powerful tower of High Sorcery,
&+Lthis building has since been converted to serve as the meeting and training
&+Lfacilities for the various spheres of magic users in the city.  Invokers,
&+LElementalists, Enchanters, and Illusionists all call this massive structure
&+L their home.  Although a great deal of time was spent preparing the tower
&+Lto house the various groups of magic users, apparently little detail was
&+Lspent in decorating it.  This small chamber is simply surrounded by colorless
&+Lgray stone walls.  The surfaces of the stones are dry, but the air has a
&+Lnoticeably cool and moist feeling to it.  A lone stone gargoyle has been set
&+Lin a small alcove along the eastern wall, serving as the only visible
&+Lgreeting for visitors.  Here and there, magical torches have been placed on
&+Lthe walls, casting a pale, greenish light upon the walls and barely
&+Lilluminating the walkway as it heads south down a long, silent hallway of
&+Lstone.  Tall wooden doors in the western wall serve as the only entrance
&+Land exit for the Guild.&N

&+cfountains in the area.  Brightly colored songbirds splash about in the waters of
&+cthe fountains, playfully bathing themselves.  Overhead, the cloudy, grayish

&+G   Here, at the center of the lush Gardens of Neverwinter, stands a massive
&+Gfountain carved entirely of a hard, white stone.  Standing as the centerpiece of
&+Gthe fountain is the intricately carved likeness of a massive tree.  The statue
&+Gis elaborately detailed with finely carved branches and leaves stretching out
&+Gover the cool, blue waters of the fountain.  An invisible, but clearly intricate
&+Gplumbing system constantly drips small amounts of water from the branches of the
&+Gtree, making it appear as though rain is continually falling off of its delicate
&+Gstone leaves.  Here and there, small amounts of moss or algae appear to have
&+Gtaken hold on the surface of the fountain, but only add to the reality of the
&+Gpiece, giving it an even more life-like appearance.  Surrounding the fountain,
&+Gthe stones of the pavement radiate outwards in an intricate, woven pattern as
&+Gthough the rocks themselves have learned to grow and twist around one another
&+Glike the vines that cling to the many trellises and archways of the small

&+Gthroughout much of the city, allowing tired travelers or contemplative 
&+Gindividuals a chance to relax and take in the artistic beauty of this place.

&+G   As Neverwinter Way passes below a high, stone arch here, it enters the

&+Gof magics and painstaking attention, these gardens are a natural wonder within 
&+Gthe city, blooming even in the harshest and most difficult of winters.  All 
&+Gthrough here, various statues and decorative planters have been arranged with 
&+Gmeticulous attention to detail.  Flowers and plants from around the Realms have 
&+Gbeen brought in and artistically arranged so as to turn the entire area into a 
&+Gsingle work of art.  Vines, both flowering and not, climb over every surface, 
&+Gsome dangling down from overhead perches and waving gently in the breeze.  
&+GAlthough the skies over Neverwinter are usually gray and lifeless, here the sun
&+Gseems to shine nearly all the time, bathing the area in a soft, yellow glow.  
&+GSongbirds can be heard singing from within the dense shrubs and foliage of the 
&+Garea, filling the air with their lighthearted songs.  The various footpaths of

&+cLord Nashar Alagondar- the ancient and mysterious Castle Never.  Rising high
&+cabove the city on the northern banks of the Neverwinter River, Castle Never
&+cis perhaps more famous for what is rumored to lie beneath it, than for its 
&+ctowering spires.  Legend has it that the catacombs deep beneath the castle
&+chold the tomb of Lord Halueth Never, an elven warrior who battled Illusk in
&+cages past.  South of the street here another of Neverwinter's grandiose
&+clandmarks, the Hall of Justice, rises several stories into the sky.  Pennants

&+GThe &N&+cHigh Road &+GThrough Neverwinter Wood&N~
   A musty, moldy odor rises from the damp earth through here, likely
emanating from the numerous rotting, moss-covered logs alongside the road.
Large, dark birds hop about in the treetops overhead, rustling the foliage 
and dropping the occasional loose leave and twig down to the surface of the
High Road.  The meager grass that manages to sprout from the densly packed
surface of the road is thick and wiry and not alltogether green.  The hard,
earthen surface of the High Road continues both north and south from here.

&+LA Large Room in Dank the Warehouse&N~
&+y   Unlike most of the other warehouses in this area of town, this massive 
&+ybuilding has fallen largely into disrepair and appears to have been unused for
&+yquite some time.  Thick, almost mossy cobwebs hang from the thick wooden beams 
&+yof the rafters overhead like dusty curtains.  The dust covering the old wooden 
&+yflooring of the warehouse is quite thick and bears the traces of several 
&+ypassing animals of indeterminate size.  The old building creaks on occasion, 
&+ygroaning with age at the constant onslaught of the elements outside.  The roof
&+yis mostly intact, but shafts of light peek through here and there, providing 
&+yonly dim illumination at best.  The wooden boards making up the flooring of 
&+ythe chamber are clearly suffering from a severe case of dry rot and every 
&+yprecarious step brings an uneasy groan from the aged wood.  In places, the 
&+yflooring has even collapsed, revealing a dark and extremely foul-smelling 
&+ychamber somewhere far below the warehouse proper.  The large and dank warehouse
&+ycontinues to the south from here, while wooden doors lead eastward to the Old 
&+yWharf Road.&N

&+LThe &N&+yOld Wharf &+LRoad&N~
   Even here, within the city walls, the gentle crashing of the waves on the
Sea of Swords can be heard faintly in the distance to the west.  Accompanying
the sound of the ocean is a light and cool sea breeze, smelling faintly of
the salty sea mist kicked up as the waves crash against the stony shores of
the Bay of Mists.  Wooden roofs atop the tall buildings surrounding the street
creak slightly in the breeze, hinting at the age of the structures.  West of
here, a large warehouse snakes its way along a bend in the city walls.  The
Old Wharf Road continues to the north and east of here.

   The relatively straight path of the Old Wharf Road bends through here to
match the natural curvature of Neverwinter's nearby walls.  Several short 
buildings stand alongside the road here, somewhat contorted as they attempt to
match the bend in the street.  A light, cool breeze blows through the air, 
gently pushing the gray clouds overhead.  Every now and then, a stray dog or 
cat will pad down the street, sniffing small bits of interesting debris on the
surface of the road.  The Old Wharf Road curves from the south to the west as
is makes its way through the city here.

&+Lproviding only meager, grayish light to the tower's interior.  Cold, lifeless 
&+Llanterns dangle high overhead, suspended by chains hanging from the unseen

&+Lof humidity.  A thin, highly worn carpeting has been stretched down the middle
&+Lof the hallway, but its threadbare surface provides very little, if any padding
&+Lor noise reduction to the hard stones that lie beneath.  The hallway continues

&+LThe Entrance to &+GMarvolds' Tavern&N~
&+y   This spacious chamber serves as the main entrance to Marvolds' Tavern,
&+yfamous in the city of Neverwinter for serving many a tankard of cool ale 
&+yamong the surrounding greenery of Garden Street.  Unlike many of the other
&+ytaverns of the city more famous for their unique buildings or occasional
&+ybar brawl, Marvolds' appears rather uninteresting and tame.  The crowd
&+ygathered about the tavern is sparse and seated quietly throughout the various
&+yrooms of the building.  Although occasional shouts and sporadic laughter
&+yoccasionally break the relative hush of the tavern, the patrons' conversations
&+yare primarily subdued and seem to center more on intellectual discussions than
&+yon the raucous boasting found in most other drinking establishments.  Here and
&+ythere, members of the more noble families of the city can be seen, indicating 
&+ythe somewhat elevated status of the tavern.  The rather plain wood and plaster
&+ystructure of the tavern continues to the south of here where it appears to open

&+G   West of the trellised gardens here stands a large, bustling tavern.  Loud 
&+Gshouts and laughter from within the tavern periodically shatter the relative 
&+Gcalm and serenity of this particular corner of the gardens.  Much like the 
&+Gforested hills of the Upland Rise, many of the original trees from the 
&+GNeverwinter Wood have been left to grow through here, albeit meticulously 
&+Gmanicured and groomed by the masterful gardeners of the city. Despite the

&+G   Tall stone pillars, delicately carved with the tales of the founding of the 
&+Gcity, stand along the walkways here.  Thin, flowerless vines have grown up
&+Garound the pillars, adding the green color of their leafy foliage to the dull-
&+Ggray of the pillars' stone.  Along the bases of the pillars, low stone planters
&+Ghave been constructed and now house a wide variety of plants.  While many of the
&+Gplants are clearly specimens from the surrounding Neverwinter Wood, others 
&+Gappear to come from lands very foreign to the often snow-covered city of 
&+GNeverwinter.  Cactus-like plants from desert regions intermingle with large-
&+Gleafed palms from the jungles of Chult in a living work of art that can only 
&+Gbe described as breathtaking.  The magics and hands-on care required to maintain
&+Gthis wide variety of plant life in all types of weather must be quite 
&+Gcomplicated.  The Gardens of Neverwinter continue to the north and west of here,

&+Lfurnishings.  A small but elaborate desk stands along the western wall, facing
&+Lthe thick iron door of the cell.  A simple wooden bench has been placed along

&+Lprisoners who are waiting to be detained or released.  A few weapons are stored
&+Lin a rack near the desk, but it does not look as though they see much, if any,
&+Luse here.  The highly polished, red-veined marble of the northern wall has been
&+Linset with a golden symbol for Tyr, god of Justice, to remind prisoners of the
&+Lpatron deity of this facility.  A few magical torches burn smokelessly in brass
&+Lsconces on the walls, providing ample light for all but the highest corners of

the High Road continues its trek through the northern Realms.  The grass
atop the surface of the road is worn short and occasionally bare under
the relatively frequent foot traffic of adventurers and travelers as they
make their way to and from their varied destinations.  Every now and then,
a small woodland creature will poke its head from the underbrush to gaze
about the surface of the road, but they disappear back into the wood as
silently as they came.  The High Road continues both east and south from

&+GThe &N&+cHigh Road &+GThrough Neverwinter Wood&N~
   A musty odor hangs in the air through here, likely emanating from the
various musrooms and fungi sprouting from several old tree trunks left
alongside the road through here.  Much of the construction of the path of 
the High Road through here involved clearing out the dense foliage of the 
Neverwinter Wood, including the massive trees that still line the sides of
the road like a natural wall.  The trees cleared out through here were 
apparently left where they fell, rather than being carried away, and have
slowly begun the natural process of decomposition.  Although the odor of
the area is not necessarily harmful, it is clearly not pleasant and the 
time spent in this area should likely be kept to a minimum.  The High
Road continues both east and west from here.

&+LA Large Room in the Dank Warehouse&N~
&+y   The musty odor that permeates the majority of this warehouse seems even 
&+ystronger and more pungent in this room.  In places, the rotting flooring of 
&+ythe chamber sprouts thick layers of mold and fungus, fed by thin rivulets of 
&+ymoisture running down the wooden support beams from the rooftop overhead.  In 
&+yplaces, thin and sickly-looking vines can be seen climbing up the walls, 
&+yattempting to reach towards the meager light provided by the occasional 
&+yaperture in the roof overhead.  A few dirty and broken windows dot the 
&+ysouthern and western walls of this room, serving only as entry points for the
&+ynumerous pigeons which can be heard cooing unseen in the rafters overhead.  As
&+ythe warehouse passes through here, it appears as though a hasty connecting 
&+ydoorway has been created in the eastern wall, leading to another chamber in 
&+ywhat was once a separate building all together.  This main room of the

&+LAn Ajoining Chamber to the Dank Warehouse&N~
&+r   The brick and mortar walls of this chamber differ significantly from the 
&+rolder, wooden walls of the dank warehouse to the west, but the general 
&+rcondition of the building does not appear to fare any better.  The brick walls 
&+rhave collapsed in places, leaving piles of rubble to obscure large portions of 
&+rthe chamber.  Perhaps from the weight of this rubble, and perhaps due only to 
&+rthe advanced rot that seems to permeate these buildings, the flooring has 
&+rcollapsed in places, revealing more subterranean chambers to the warehouse.  
&+rThis brick and mortar portion of the warehouse, likely a hastily built or 
&+racquired annex, continues to the south from here across the precarious wooden

&+LA Bend in The &N&+yOld Wharf &+LRoad&N~
   Buildings of various shapes and sizes jut out towards the Old Wharf Road at
odd, right angles as the street twists and turns through here.  Overhanging 
roofs provide a great deal of shade, keeping the air of the area relatively
cool and moist.  Occasionally, large, fully-laden carts attempt to navigate
down the street on their way through the city, but are often confounded by
the somewhat tricky routing required to steer the carts between the buildings.
The Old Wharf Road weaves north and east through here.

&+LThe &N&+yOld Wharf &+LRoad&N~
   Random stacks of iron-rimmed barrels stand off to the side of the road,
awaiting transport to a storage facility.  A strong, ale-like smell hangs in
the area, apparently coming from the contents of the barrels.  It is quite 
likely that the owner of a local tavern would be less than pleased that his
latest shipment was left standing in the streets, despite the relatively
cool air.  Random pigeons line the edges of the rooftops overhead, cooing
quietly to one another.  Occasionally, something startles a large group of the
birds, causing them to flap off noisly over the city.  The Old Wharf Road
continues east and west through here.

&+LThe &N&+yOld Wharf &+LRoad&N~
   Large, somewhat delapidated buildings surround the sides of the Old Wharf
Road as it passes through the warehouse district of the city.  Unlike the rest
of the city of Neverwinter, the area of the surrounding warehouse district is
rather typical of other cities in its appearance.  The surface of the road,
though still relatively well-maintained, is quite a bit rougher than the other
streets of the city, some of which seem almost as smooth and even as glass.
Here and there, potholes in the surface of the road have filled with runoff,
creating small, dirty pools of water.  Pigeons and other birds of the city
occasionally land near some of the pools, contemplating a bath in the stagnant
water, but most apparently choose to move on in search of cleaner finds.  The
Old Wharf Road continues to the south and west of here.

&+bThe Shop of the &+LMages' Guild of Neverwinter&N~
&+L   Mysterious and arcane objects, some of which defy explanation or description,
&+Lhang throughout this walls of this small chamber.  A low, woodless fire burns 
&+Lin a fireplace set in the eastern wall, keeping the normally bone-numbing chill
&+Lof the Mages' Guild at bay.  Strange odors hang in the air throughout the 
&+Lchamber, eminating from all manner of herbs and spell ingredients, apparently 
&+Lgathered from throughout the Realms and perhaps, beyond.  A counter of black 
&+Lmarble stands along the southern wall, behind which sits the shopkeeper of the
&+LGuild, a surprisingly young-looking mage clothed in simple, midnight-blue robes.
&+LThe only visible exit from the chamber is through the stone hallway to the north

&+w   Tucked neatly into this tiny building, this shop is adorned with all types
&+wof bows, arrows and thrown weapons.  Ranging from small, handheld crossbows to
&+wgiant longbows made of stout yew, dozens of different archery weapons adorn the
&+wwalls and rafters of the store.  Also on display, behind the long counter at the
&+wback of the store, are a number different arrows and thrown knives and darts. 
&+wEach is decorated with a variety of multi-colored flights, denoting different
&+wweights and sizes for the darts and arrows.  The air of the shop seems very dry

&+LA Large Room in the &+GTavern&N~
&+y   Much like the entryway of the tavern to the north, the patrons of this room
&+yseem engrossed in their various, quiet conversations and seem to take notice of
&+ylittle else.  Here and there, waitresses pass between the tables, ensuring the
&+ytaverngoers are amply stocked with food and beverages.  The walls of this room
&+yare filled with memorabilia from many of the city's famous adventuring
&+ycompanies, the members of which have mostly retired and can be seen seated at
&+yvarious tables in the tavern, partaking in the conversations.  Unlike the days
&+yof their youth when loud, boastful stories of their heroic deeds and perilous
&+yadventurers were told half in a drunken haze, the aged men seated around the
&+ytables have long since settled into a more elder and reserved demeanor.  Too
&+yold to journey the Realms as they once did, these men are content to enjoy
&+ytheir retirements in the peaceful company of friends and family.  To the east
&+yof here, however, a set of double wooden doors seems to lead to a smaller, much
&+ylouder chamber in the tavern where the more typical bar atmosphere of shouts
&+yand music can be heard faintly.&N

&+LThe Back Room of &+GMarvold's Tavern&N~
&+y   This room, in sharp contrast to the rest of the quiet tavern, is awash in
&+ysounds and youthful exuberance.  Although a few of the individuals in this
&+ychamber are older in appearance, the majority of the patrons here appear
&+yquite young.  Occasional outbursts of laughter or shouted challenges echo
&+ythrough the room, drowning out the light music played by a few wandering
&+yperformers.  A long, oaken bar has been set in the eastern wall, apparently
&+ycarved from a single, massive tree.  Pints of ale and spiced wine flow freely
&+yfrom the wall of massive barrels behind the bar, consumed as quickly as they
&+ycan be poured by the barkeeps and waitresses working the room.  Several tables
&+yare scattered about the room, encircled by crowds of taverngoers seeking to
&+yhear the latest gossip or tale of heroic adventure.  The wooden floors of this
&+yroom are soaked in places with pools of spilled drink and have become quite
&+yslippery.  Every now and then, a member of the crowd will lose their balance
&+yand fall crashing to the floor, much to the amusement of their surrounding
&+ycomrades.  It is unlikely, however, that the damp flooring is the sole
&+ycontributor to the mishaps.  A pair of thick, wooden doors leads west from
&+yhere toward a much quieter chamber of Marvold's Tavern.&N

   Thin streaks of pale, yellow sunlight streak through the canopy of trees
overhead, playing softly on the surface of the street below.  A combination of
trees from various parts of the Realms line the sides of the street help to 
form the almost roof-like layer of branches and leaves overhead.  A thick, lush
moss grows on the trunks and branches of many of the trees, giving off a damp
and earth-like scent.  Here and there, small twigs and leaves have fallen from 
the trees and lie trampled on the surface of the road, awaiting their eventual
removal by the city's street cleaners.  Garden Street continues to the south of
here as it makes its way through the city.  To the north, through a high stone
arch that is nearly hidden by the natural canopy overhead, lie the famous and
richly decorated Gardens of Neverwinter.

&+Lof reddish marble are spaced along the hall, supporting the weight of the

&+wfrom the rudimentary gutters over the road, collecting in small pools on the

of the Neverwinter Wood.  The normally dense trees of the forest thin somewhat
with the rise in the road, allowing a slightly obstructed view of a portion of
the City of Neverwinter far to the west of here along the horizon.  In the air,
the slight smell of burning wood can be detected, coming from somewhere within
the depths of the wood.  The sky above the road here is rather dull and gray
with very few hints of blue sky breaking through the seemingly omnipresent

&+LAnother Room in the Warehouse&N~
&+r   The creaking and groaning of the surrounding structure is even more apparent
&+rthrough here as the old warehouse appears more and more unstable.  A few of the
&+rbrick walls of the room have started to sag significantly under the weight of 
&+rthe roof overhead, and it is probably only a matter of time before this portion
&+rof the structure collapses all together.  The rafters overhead seem to have 
&+rheld up relatively well, but the constant dampness and years of neglect have no
&+rdoubt taken their toll.  The flooring of the room has fallen away in several 
&+rplaces, revealing a chamber or series of chambers far below this room.  The 
&+roccasional glint of light reflecting from below would seem to indicate that at
&+rleast some of the chambers below this one have been flooded, either by the 
&+rnearby harbor or the vast network of sewers beneath Neverwinter.  Although this
&+rchamber was once used for storage, all remnants of the goods once stored here 
&+rappear to have been removed, replaced only by random piles of rubble and

&+LAn Old Office in the Warehouse&N~
&+L   Apparently forgotten for quite some time, this old office seems to be in 
&+Lmuch the condition is was left in once the warehouse was abandoned.  Several
&+Lfile cabinets and scroll cases containing shipping records for the warehouse
&+Lcan still be seen lining the walls.  A simple wooden desk occupies a majority
&+Lof the floor space in the center of the room, its ancient wooden chair still
&+Lpushed in neatly behind it.  Small gnawing marks can be seen along the bases 
&+Lof much of the remaining furniture, indicating the familiar presence of rats
&+Lor other vermin.  Thick, dusty cobwebs hang from the low ceiling, clinging 
&+Lannoying to almost anything that passes beneath them.  A large, dark mural of
&+LNeverwinter's harbor still hangs along the eastern wall behind the desk, 
&+Laltough time and the moisture in the air have deteriorated much of its former
&+Ldetail.  In one corner of the chamber, a stack of kindling can be seen amid a

&+wthis chamber probably served as the sleeping quarters for the soldiers stationed
&+wat the keep.  However, two of the room's thick stone walls have collapsed inward
&+wfrom the impact of some unknown force, crushing and burying much of the room's
&+winterior.  Whether there were any soldiers in this room at the time of the 
&+wcollapse remains to be seen.  However, the lack of the presence of any rescue
&+wworkers or repairmen in here would seem to suggest that all of the room's 
&+woccupants have been accounted for.  The heavily damaged keep along the

   A slighly acrid, smokey scent hangs in the air here although the exact
source of the smell is not readily apparent.  Luckily, the nearly constant
breeze of the area manages to keep the odor from growing too strong.  Overhead,
wooden shingled rooftops help protect the contents of the warehouses that line
the sides of the street.  Most of the stone and plaster buildings of the area
are windowless and offer no real clues to what may be stored inside.  As the
road heads generally westward from here, its surface tends gradually downhill
as it nears the harbor and docks of the city.  In the skies overhead, a random
gull or two can be seen hovering quietly in the breeze, further attesting to
the nearness of the waters of the Sea of Swords.  The Old Wharf Road continues
through the warehouse district both north and east of here.

   The ancient surface of the Old Wharf Road continues through the warehouse
district of Neverwinter through here.  Tall, somewhat dilapidated buildings
line the sides of the street, used primarily for the short-term storage of
the goods that are shipped into the city via Neverwinter's harbor.  Although
the rulers of Neverwinter frown upon the somewhat run-down nature of the
buildings in this area, their relative isolation from the rest of the city
allows them to remain standing.  In the air, a slightly salty smell is blown
down the street here, born in the skies above the Sea of Swords.  The surface
of the road, though relatively well-kept, is starting to show its age and
small potholes have begun to form in its stoney surface.  The Old Wharf Road
continues west and east of here where it merges with several of the other
main arteries of the city.

&+Wbegins its humble journey, sprouting numerous varieties of plants and flowers,
&+Wwhich fill the air with a sweet scent.  Largely in response to the number of

   As Garden Street passes through here, the normally dense foliage lining the

replanting by the garden crews of the city.  The air here, normally fragrant 
with the sweet smells of blossoming plants, is relatively stale and stagnant.  
Tall, grayish stone buildings line the sides of this rather drab section of the 
street.  To the south stands &+yManycoins Moneylending&N, the southern bank of 
the City of Neverwinter.  Although accused of illegitimate business in the past,
this establishment has since been deemed the official bank of the southern half 
of the city by the government of Lord Nashar, and is now watched rather closely.
Garden Street continues to the east and west through here.

&+GGarden Street in &+WNeverwinter&N~
   A massive building rises to the south of the street here, towering several
stories over the rest of the buildings in the area.  High atop the building's
slate-shingled roof, banners displaying the symbol of Helm flap quietly in the
breeze.  As one of the three major temples in the city, the &+bTemple of Helm&N is
dedicated to the god of protection and defense.  Much like the nearby city of
Helm's Hold, Neverwinter attributes much of its stability and prosperity to the
god Helm and his watchful eye.  Garden Street continues to make its way through
the city to the east and west of here.

Street are quite breathtaking in their simplistic and natural beauty.  As the
vines overhead wave gently in the breeze, an aire of tranquility settles upon
this portion of the street.  Several local citizens have chosen to relax on the
stone benches placed sporadically about the street under the shade provided by 
the vines.  The massive &+bTemple of Helm&N continues along the south side of the

&+wA Small Chamber in the &+RHall of Justice&N~

&+Lone of the judges or priests of the temple.  The walls of the chamber are 
&+Llined with bookshelves detailing a variety of legal traditions and the history
&+Lof many of the cases tried before the temple's court.  In addition to books 
&+Ldedicated solely to law, many of the bookshelves contain volumes ranging from

&+Lmuch natural light to the room as possible.  Several glass globes lit with 
&+Lmagical light have also been spaced along the walls of the chamber to help 
&+Lprovide illumination when the light from this skylights is inadequate.  Unlike 
&+Lmuch of the rest of this temple, this room is extremely quiet, likely due to

&+RThe Great Hall of Justice&N~
&+w   This massive chamber, in addition to serving as the main hall of worship
&+wfor the Neverwinter's followers of Tyr, also serves as the primary courtroom
&+wfor the city.  The southern wall of the chamber features a massive statue of
&+wTyr, holding a set of golden scales in one hand and a massive golden hammer 
&+win the other.  In front of the statue stands a tall bench where the High 
&+wCourt of Neverwinter presides over important cases.  The majority of the wide
&+wchamber is filled with numerous benches to accomodate worshippers during 
&+wceremonies and the audiences that tend to flock to watch important trials and
&+wlegal decisions by the court.  The entire chamber appears to be made primarily
&+wof a deep, red marble flecked with veins of black and gold.  A rich, white 
&+wstone and golden fixtures have been used to accent the red marble of the 
&+wchamber.  The center of the chamber's floor has been set with a flowing pattern
&+wof mosaic tiles, twisting outwards from a golden plate set in the very center
&+wof the room.  Small, unobtrusive doors lead both east and west from the

&+wA Smaller Courtroom in the &+RHall of Justice&N~
&+L   This smaller, far less grandiose courtroom serves as the trial and sentencing
&+Lchamber for those crimes not worthy of the High Court which presides over the
&+LGreat Hall of Justice.  Basic day-to-day cases involving the petty criminals and
&+Lcommon thieves of the city brought to this chamber so as to more effectively 
&+Lprocess their cases and avoid wasting the time of the main court.  The relative
&+Lprosperity of the city has lessened the number of such cases in recent years, 
&+Lbut the ever-watchful eyes of the town guard and militia still manage to 
&+Lapprehend their share of criminals.  This room, while much less elaborate than 
&+Lthe Great Hall to the west, is still relatively well appointed.  The marble 
&+Lwalls remain intact and still adorned with the occasional gold embelleshment.
&+LThe furniture of the chamber is quite simple and made of a sturdy, thick wood.  
&+LA judge's bench has been set up along the southern wall, slightly eleveated from
&+Lthe rest of the chamber.  Two wooden doors lead north and west from the chamber

&+wcollapsed under a massive impact of some sort, partially covering a portion of

&+LInside the Southwestern Gates of &N&+cNeverwinter&N~
&+L   An immense patchwork of scaffording and construction equipment stands here,
&+Lsurrounding the small square near the southwestern gates of the city.  Judging
&+Lby the amount of rubble strewn about the small square and the obvious scorching
&+Lon some of the stone walls, it appears as though this construction project is
&+Lnot merely a series of city improvements.  Repair crews and foreman scramble 
&+Labout on the ground and on the scaffolding overhead, attempting to repair the
&+Ldamage as quickly as possible.  Large wagons, laden with fresh stone and mortar
&+Lhave been lined up off to the side of the square, waiting to be unloaded.  
&+LPerhaps most devestating about the damage of the area is the blockage of the
&+Lsouthwestern gates of the city.  A high mound of rubble, likely the stone that
&+Lmade up the battlements above the gate that are no longer present, now 
&+Lcompletely blocks passage out of the city.  The twisted remains of the massive
&+Liron portcullis of the gates can be seen protruding from the debris.  Small 
&+Lveins of acrid-smelling smoke still rise from some of the larger piles of 
&+Lstone, hinting at small smoldering fires lingering beneath.  Although no bodies
&+Lor injured soldiers can be seen in the area, it is impossible to think that 
&+Lsuch widespread damage could have occurred without any casualties.  Whomever or
&+Lwhatever caused this amount of damage to the sturdy stone walls of Neverwinter 
&+Lmust have been very powerful, indeed.  Wyrmfrost Road continues northward into

&+wThe smell of burning incense hangs lightly in the cool, clear air, which seems
&+wblown about slowly by some unseen presence.  Several rows of benches have been
&+wset up in the middle of the chamber, facing the western wall where a massive
&+waltar to Helm has been set up.  Matching the white, blue, and gold motif of the
&+wrest of the Temple, the altar to Helm consists of a white, flat slab of marble
&+wupon which rests the likeness of a giant blue hand with a golden eye set into 
&+wits palm.  The golden eye set into the hand seems to radiate light and it is
&+wdifficult to tell if the gold is simply reflecting the light supplied by the

&+WThe Entryway to the &N&+bTemple of Helm&N~

&+wlarge Temple to Helm.  While not as grandiose as the temple found at Helm's 
&+wHold far to the southwest of the city, this temple is still immaculately 
&+warchitectured and crafted.  Vaulted ceilings the color of deep blue sapphires
&+wrise high above the floors of the temple.  Set in the center of the blue 
&+wceiling is a giant golden eye, illuminated with numerous magical spheres of 
&+wlight so that it shines radiant light upon the floor of the temple at all 
&+wtimes.  The entire structure has a feeling of protection about it.  Many of 
&+wthe temple alcolytes wander slowly about the chamber, quietly assisting 
&+windividuals who may be in need.  Although the temple complex continues well 
&+wto the west of here, only those of faith are allowed to pass beyond this

&+WCity of Neverwinter&N rise to the north.  Anchored solidly in the ancient
stone walls which surround the city, the sturdy steel and wooden gates have
protected the citizens of Neverwinter from beasts and raids for decades.  
Heavily armed guards stand a silent watch along the battlements atop the 
city walls as standards bearing the Great Seal of the City flap lazily in
the breeze.  Now and then, watchmen can be heard calling to one another from
their vantage points above the city.  Thin whisps of smoke dissipate slowly
into the gray skies over the city as they rise from the numerous stone
chimneys and smokestacks of Neverwinter's homes and forges.  South and east
of the gates of the city, the High Road continues its slow trek through the
northern reaches along the Trackless Sea.

As a light breeze blows along the High Road, filling the air with a thin, 
light dust from the packed earth surface of the trail.  As the road continues

   Turning gradually from west to north to avoid a large, rocky cliff to the 
east, the High Road continues to make its way through the Neverwinter Wood.  The
tall, gray rocks of the cliff are largely covered with a thick, green moss.  
Steady trickles of moisture run down the face of the cliff, darkening the color
of the rocks and filling the air with the quiet sounds of running water.  Here
and there, a few brave trees have tried to take root on the very face of the 
cliff, but do not appear to be thriving from their precarious perches above the
road.  At the base of the cliff rest several large boulders that appear to have
dislodged from the cliff's face and tumbled to the surface of the road.

&+GOn the &N&+cHigh Road&+G Near &+WNeverwinter&N~
   The usually thick and menacing trees of the Neverwinter Wood appear to
thin through here, allowing for greater visibility.  With the greater range
of view, it is possible to make out the southeastern gates of the city of
Neverwinter just to the north of here.  The usually eathy smells of the
forest have also been replaced with a lighter, airy breeze that smells 
faintly of salt air from the nearby Trackless Sea.  South of here, the High
Road re-enters the dense trees of the Neverwinter Wood as it makes its
trek towards Waterdeep far to the south.

&+b   Overhead, the dull gray stones of the Dolphin Bridge block out many of 
&+bthe sounds of city, leaving only the quiet sounds of the lapping of the river
&+bagainst the stone abutments to the bridge.  A cool breeze blows through the
&+bslight tunnel formed by the bridge, carrying the somewhat tepid odor of 
&+bstagnant river water.  Here and there, small viney plants have started to
&+bgrow on the stone underside of the bridge, apparently thriving despite the
&+brelative lack of light.  The Neverwinter River continues to both the north

&+WThe &N&+bNeverwinter River&+W Through &N&+cNeverwinter&N~
&+b   Through here, the stony walls surrounding the waters of the Neverwinter 
&+bRiver are caked with fist-sized globs of light brown mud and grass.  At
&+bfirst glance, these balls of mud and grass appear to be nothing more than
&+blarge chunks of filth attached to the walls.  However, numerous black and
&+bwhite river swallows sit perched amid small openings in the mud and
&+bperiodically dive-bomb passing boaters and other, larger birds, indicating
&+bthat this is more likely a massive nesting site.  The swallows along the
&+bNeverwinter River in the city are highly regarded by residents due to the
&+bfact that, despite their unsightly droppings, they make a tremendous 
&+bimpact on the insect population that once ran rampant along the slow, warm
&+bwaters of the river.  Lord Nashar is credited with having the insight to
&+bhave some of the birds brought in from their native nesting areas amidst
&+bthe cliffs outside of town to their new, more urban habitat.  The Neverwinter
&+bRiver flows east and west from here.&N

&+Lmaintenance checks of the bridge are necessary to ensure that none of the

&+Bwritten in a number of languages and on nearly every subject imaginable. A
&+Bgreat deal of the volumes seem to deal with the history of the northern 
&+Breaches, particularily with the history of the city of Neverwinter.  Several
&+Blarge maps can also be seen on display, showing the evolution of the various
&+Bcity-states and territories of the Realms over the centuries.  Several 
&+Bstudious individuals are seated at the long wooden desks in the center of the
&+Broom, using large, magical reading crystals to translate the various texts 
&+Binto their respective native languages.  High overhead, skylights pierce the

&+wthe city gates and the passing surface of the High Road.  An iron-shuttered window

&+L   Residing near the pinnacle of the tower of the Mages' Guild, this chamber
&+Llooks out around its perimeter at the vast and sprawling city of Neverwinter.
&+LThe gray stones of the tower seem somewhat warmer here, perhaps due to the
&+Lmeager amounts of sunlight that actually manage to penetrate the thinly
&+Lpaned windows.  A gaping hole stands in the center of the chamber, dropping
&+Ldown through a vertical shaft in the tower that seems obscured by an
&+Lunnatural darkness.  A thick, solitary rope hangs unnaturally, apparently
&+Lthrough the stone ceiling of the chamber itself, down through the center of
&+Lthe hole, providing a means of navigating downward through the uncertain
&+Ldarkness.  The only other apparent means of egress from this chamber would
&+Lbe via the four, glowing portals that lead off in each of the four cardinal
&+Ldirections.  Beside each portal is a small plaque, each bearing a single

&+LA Long, Sloping Hallway in the &N&+cBards' Guild&N~
&+c   Sloping gradually downwards from west to east through here, this hallway
&+cvisibly declines several feet through here.  Towards the eastern end, the
&+clevel of the hallway flattens out and forms a slight platform near two iron 
&+cdoors set in the eastern and southern walls.  The simple stones of the walls
&+cand floor, though clearly quite ancient, still retain a rather rough surface
&+cindicating they have seen very little wear in their time.  Faint, lighthearted
&+cmusic can be heard in the air, though its exact source remains unclear.
&+cTo the west of here, near the far end of the hallway, a staircase can be
&+cfaintly seen leading upwards.&N

&+LA &+CCrystal Domed&+L Cavern&N~
&+c   This circular chamber appears to have been a natural cavern at one time
&+chollowed out by the passing waters of the Neverwinter River.  Now, the 
&+cwaters of the river can be seen flowing on the other side of the crystal 
&+cceiling of this chamber, casting a swirling and twisting combination of 
&+ccolor and light throughout the room.  Thick, twisting roots from what must 
&+cbe a massive tree reach downwards from the crystalline ceiling overhead to 
&+cbury themselves once more in the rocky floor of the chamber.  The flooring of 
&+cthe cavern has been covered in a thick red carpeting, softening the sound of 
&+cthe constant music eminating from the dozens of instruments lining the walls 
&+cof the room.  Although no one appears to be playing the instruments, they 
&+ceach emit a quiet tune of their own.  The various songs all seem to blend 
&+ctogether, harmonizing and contrasting with one another as though playing a 
&+cwell planned symphony.  This beautiful, clandestine chamber seems an excellent
&+cchoice to serve as the main guild hall for the Bard's Guild of Neverwinter.&N

&+LA Small Shop in the &N&+cBards' Guild&N~
&+c   This small chamber ajoining the hallway to the north appears to serve as
&+cthe main shop for the Bards' Guild.  While not nearly as large as many of the
&+cother guilds within the city, the Bards' Guild is probably more famous for
&+cits rather clandestine setting and rumors of its beautiful Crystalline Hall
&+chidden beneath the surface of the Neverwinter River.  The stone walls of this
&+croom are covered with the various simple wares offered for sale in the shop.
&+cA lone shopkeeper sits behind the shop's plain wooden counter, absent-mindedly
&+cstrumming a lute hanging on the wall near her.&N

&+WThe Head Cleric's Chamber in the &N&+bTemple of Helm&N~
&+w   High, stained glass windows line three of the four walls of this spacious
&+wchamber, streaming shafts of multi-colored into the room.  The vaulted ceilings
&+woverhead echo with the sounds of hymns and prayers from the main prayer hall of
&+wthe Temple of Helm far below.  Although large, this room lacks nearl all 
&+wdecoration.  A simple carpet on the floor in the center of the chamber bears the
&+wholy symbol of the god Helm, the Ever-Vigilant.  Standing silently in the center
&+wof the carpet, staring solemnly out the windows of the temple and meditating in
&+wthe peace and serenity of his surroundings, is the head of the local Clerics' 
&+wGuild.  The only apparent exit from this room is through a pair of thick, double
&+wdoors in the eastern wall of the chamber.&N

&+WAn Upper Chamber in the &N&+bTemple of Helm&N~
&+w   Here at the top of the wide, spiraling marble staircase lie the upper levels
&+wof the Temple of Helm.  Typically reserved for the alcolytes and priests of the
&+wtemple, these rooms are rarely, if ever, visited by the common citizens of the
&+wcity.  Although far more conservative than the vaulted rooms below, the fine 
&+wstonework and marblework of the temple continues through here.  High crystalline
&+wwindows, recessed in the stone walls of the chamber, allow as much light from
&+wthe outside into the room as possible.  Every now and then, a cool, crisp breeze
&+wblows through one of the opened panes, bringing the fresh scents of the outdoors
&+winto the room and slightly dissipating the cloying smell of incense that seems
&+wto permeate the inner rooms of the temple.  Two doors in the eastern and western
&+wwalls of this room apparently lead to other chambers of the temple.&N

&+WA Small, Quiet Chamber in the &N&+bTemple of Helm&N~
&+w   The ceilings of this small chamber are barely high enough for an average-
&+wsized human to stand without striking their head against the low-hanging
&+wstone supports.  Seemingly put here as an afterthought, this chamber is still
&+wwell crafted with carved stone detailing and a few small, stained glass
&+wwindows which manage to dimly illuminate the room.  A low stone table of sorts
&+whas been placed along the eastern wall in front of one of the larger windows.
&+wSeveral tall, white pillar candles burn almost smokelessly on its surface amid
&+wthe waxy remnants of dozens of their kind.  Behind the table sits a wisened old
&+wman, hunched over with the weight of years, but still glowing with a youthful
&+wexuberance as he gazes out the window towards the city below.&N

&+rA Cozy Study in the &+yMoonstone Mask&N~
&+r   This room appears to function as an office of sorts.  Numerous cabinets
&+rline the wooden walls of the room while a large, stone and wood desks occupies
&+ra prominent place in the center of the chamber.  The file cabinets, far from
&+rbeing uniform, are of all shapes and sizes, many of them locked with large
&+rpadlocks and glyphs of warding.  It would appear from the rather chaotic nature
&+rof the furniture that this room may actually serve as an office for several,
&+rrather disparate individuals who come here every so often to review their own
&+rrespective paperwork.  A few slips of paper have been carelessly left on the
&+rpolished stone top of the desk, but a cursory glance at them reveals what 
&+rappears to be a grocery list of sorts.  The room itself is illuminated by
&+rseveral glowing spheres of light mounted in metallic brackets on the wooden
&+rwalls.  A few, unburned candles stand atop the surface of the desk and a
&+rfireplace in the eastern wall, while cold now, appears to also be used as an
&+roccasional source of heat and light for the room.  Only two, very small windows
&+rlook outward from the chamber and both are secured with thick, iron bars against
&+rany unauthorized entry.  A simple wooden doorway leads southward from this room.&N

&+rAn Upper Chamber in the &+yMoonstone Mask&N~
&+r   The generally luxurious trappings of the Moonstone Mask seem somewhat
&+rsubdued here in favor of more traditional furnishings.  The walls are still
&+rpaneled in a very dark wood, but they seem less polished and cared for here.
&+rThe vibrant laughter and shouts from the lower floors are also much quieter
&+rhere, giving this floor a much more calming and relaxed feel.  Two simple, 
&+rwooden doorways set in the northern and eastern walls along this small landing
&+rserve as the only apparent rooms on this floor.  A wide, wooden stairway also
&+rleads down from this bannistered platform towards the lower, more active 
&+rfloors of the resort.&N

&+rA Quiet Store Room in the &+yMoonstone Mask&N~
&+r   This room appears to serve as a makeshift storage area and servants
&+rquarters for the Moonstone Mask.  Several large pieces of furniture line the
&+rwooden walls of the chamber, covered in white sheets for protection against
&+rthe thick dust that covers much of the wooden flooring.  A small corner of
&+rthe room is very well-kept and seems to serve as a sort of changing area, 
&+rmost likely for the masked women who work at the resort.  A paneled screen
&+rshields off part of the corner of the chamber while several lockers and
&+rcoat hooks line the walls, some hung with womens' clothing.  Two small
&+rwindows look northward from this chamber towards the natural park in the city
&+rknown as the Upland Rise.  A small, wooden door leads westward from this
&+rchamber towards the main chambers of the Moonstone Mask while a larger, iron-
&+rclad door stands in the eastern wall.&N

&+LThe Rooftop of the &+yMoonstone Mask&N~
&+L   This area of the roof covering the sprawling Moonstone Mask has been
&+Lrenovated to accomodate something quite large.  A massive wooden platform has
&+Lbeen added to the rooftop, cleverly hidden from the prying eyse of the city 
&+Lof Neverwinter behind the bulk of the building to the west of here.  To the
&+Least, across the city walls, lies an unobstructed view of the vast Neverwinter
&+LWood as it crawls like a thick, green carpet to the horizon.  Rumors have
&+Lcirculated for some time that certain patrons of the Moonstone Mask used winged
&+Lsteeds to travel to and from the compound to avoid detection, even from
&+Ldestinations as far removed as Halruaa.  A platform of this size could easily
&+Lhandle several beasts the size of a pegasus or griffon, possibly even a creature
&+Las large as a medium-sized dragon.  Other than the sheer dropoff towards the
&+Lcity below, and almost certain death, the only visible exit from the rooftop
&+Lwould seem to be through the iron-clad door to the west.&N
